<p>'I have thought it right to reprint in a cheap form this excellent list of doctrines, which were subscribed to by the Baptist Ministers in the year 1689.  We need a banner because of the truth; it may be that this small volume may aid the cause of the glorious gospel by testifying plainly what are its leading doctrines . . . May the Lord soon restore unto His Zion a pure language, and may her watchmen see eye to eye.'  So wrote the young C.H. Spurgeon, then in the second year of his ministry at New Park Street Chapel, Southwark, in a preface addressed to All the Household of Faith, who rejoice in the glorious doctrines of Free Grace with which he prefixed this Confession when he published it in October, 1855.</p>
<p>The Confession itself was first compiled by the Elders and Brethren of many congregations of Chrisans, baptized upon their profession of faith, in London and the country (as they then described themselves) in the year 1677.  It was based upon, and drew its inspiration from the Confession drawn up by the Westminster Assembly of Divines a generation earlier, and indeed differs only from it in its teaching upon those matters, such as baptism, the Lord's Supper, and church government, upon which among the Reformed churches the Baptists differ from the Presbyterians.  For fear of persecution, the compilers of the 1677 Confession did not subscribe their names to it, but when, in September, 1689, following the Revoluon of the previous year, the Ministers and Messengers of the churches were able to meet in more peaceful mes, thirty-seven of them, including all the most eminent Baptist ministers of the day, set their names to the recommendation with which it was circulated among the churches. Thereafter for between 150 and 200 years it remained the definive Confession of Faith of the Particular (or Calvinistic) Baptist churches of england and Wales.</p>
<p>Mr. Spurgeon did not, however, when he republished this Confession, merely preface it with certain words of general commendation.  He also addressed to his own church at New Park Street some practical words of advice as to how they should use the Confession.  These are still relevant today.</p>
<p>'This little volume,' he wrote, 'is not issued as an authoritave rule, or code of faith, whereby you are to be feered, but as an assistance to you in controversy, a confirmation in faith, and a means of edification in righteousness.  Here the younger members of our church will have a body of divinity in small compass, and by means of the scriptural proofs, will be ready to give a reason for the hope that is in them.</p>
<p>Be not ashamed of your faith; remember it is the ancient gospel of the martyrs, confessors, reformers, and saints.  Above all, it is the truth of God, against which all the gates of Hell cannot prevail.  Let your lives adorn your faith, let your example adorn your creed.  Above all live in Christ Jesus, and walk in Him, giving credence to no teaching but that which is manifestly approved of Him, and owned by the Holy Spirit.  Cleave fast to the Word of God which is here mapped out for you.'  This new edition of the Confession is sent out as a private venture by a small group of Baptists who are convinced that it has a message for this generation and believe its publication to be long overdue.  They hope it will achieve a wide circulation among the churches, and receive the close study which they believe it will richly repay.</p>
<p>In England during the 1630's and the 1640's Congregationalists and Baptists of Calvinistic persuasion emerged from the Church of England. Their early existence was marked by repeated cycles of persecution at the hands of the established religion of crown and Parliament.  The infamous Clarendon Code was adopted in the 1660's to crush all dissent from the official religion of the state.  Periods of rigorous application and intervals of relaxaon of these coercive acts haunted Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists alike.</p>
<p>Presbyterians and Congregationalists suffered less than did Baptists under this harassment.  No little reason for their relative success in resisting government tyranny was their united front of doctrinal agreement.  All Presbyterians stood by their Westminster Confession of 1646.  Congregationalists adopted virtually the same articles of faith in the Savoy Confession of 1658.  Feeling their substantial unity with paedobaptists suffering under the same cruel injustice, Calvinistic Baptists met to publish their substantial harmony with them in doctrine.</p>
<p>A circular letter was sent to particular Baptist churches in England and Wales asking each assembly to send representatives to a meeting in London in 1677.  A confession consciously modeled after the Westminster Confession of Faith was approved and published.  It has ever since born the name of the Second London Confession.  The First London Confession had been issued by seven Baptist congregations of London in 1644.  That first document had been drawn up to distinguish newly organized Calvinistic Baptists from the Arminian Baptists and the Anabaptists.  Because this second London Confession was drawn up in dark hours of oppression, it was issued anonymously.</p>
<p>A preface to the original publication of 1677 says in part: '. . . It is now many years since diverse of us . . . did conceive ourselves under a necessity of publishing a Confession of our Faith, for the information and satisfaction of those that did not thoroughly understand what our principles were, of had entertained prejudices against our profession . . . This was first put forth about the year 1643, in the  name of seven congregations then gathered in London . . .'  (These early Baptists were conscious that the 1644 Calvinistic Baptist Confession predated the 1646 Presbyterian Confession and the 1658 Congregaonalist Confession).</p>
<p>'Forasmuch as this confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that many others have since embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us to join together in giving a testimony to the world of our firm adhering to those wholesome principles . . .'</p>

<p>The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, <strong>[1]</strong> although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation. <strong>[2]</strong> Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry mes and in diversified manners to reveal Himself, and to declare (that) His will unto His church; <strong>[3]</strong> and afterward for the beer preserving and propagang of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corrupon of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto wring; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now completed. <strong>[4]</strong></p>

<p>The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human wrings. <strong>[6]</strong> Luke 24:27,44; Rom. 3:2</p>

<p>The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, depends not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God. <strong>[7]</strong></p>

<p>We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to a high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and enre perfecons thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts. <strong>[8]</strong></p>

<p>The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any me is to be added, whether by new revelaon of the Spirit, or tradions of men.   Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illuminaon of the Spirit <strong>[9]</strong> of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, <strong>[10]</strong> and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the church, common to human acons and sociees, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Chrisan prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed. <strong>[11]</strong> </p>

<h2 id="an-appendix">AN APPENDIX<a class="headerlink" href="#an-appendix" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Whosoever reads, and imparally considers what we have in our forgoing confession declared, may readily perceive, That we do not only concenter with all other true Chrisans on the Word of God (revealed in the Scriptures of truth) as the foundaon and rule of our faith and worship. But that we have also industriously endeavoured to manifest, That in the fundamental Articles of Chrisanity we mind the same things, and have therefore expressed our belief in the same words, that have on the like occasion been spoken by other sociees of Chrisans before us.</p>
<p>This we have done, That those who are desirous to know the principles of Religion which we hold and pracse, may take an esmate from our selves (who jointly concur in this work) and may not be misguided, either by undue reports; or by the ignorance or errors of particular persons, who going under the same name with our selves, may give an occasion of scandalizing the truth we profess.</p>
<p>And although we do differ from our brethren who are Paedobaptists; in the subject and administraon of Baptisme, and such other circumstances as have a necessary dependence on our observance of that Ordinance, and do frequent our own assemblies for our mutual edification, and discharge of those dues, and services which we owe unto God, and in his fear to each other: yet we would not be from hence misconstrued, as if the discharge of our own consciences herein, did any wayes disoblige or alienate our affecons, or conversaon from any others that fear the Lord; but that we may and do as we have opportunity parcipate of the labors of those, whom God hath indued with abilies above our selves, and qualified, and called to the Ministry of the Word, earnestly desiring to approve our selves to be such, as follow after peace with holyness, and therefore we alwaies keep that blessed Irenicum, or healing Word of the Apostle before our eyes; if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you; nevertheless whereto we have already aained; let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing, Phil 3. v. 15, 16.</p>
<p>Let it not therefore be judged of us (because much hath been wrien on this subject, and yet we connue this our pracse different from others) that it is out of obsnacy, but rather as the truth is, that we do herein according to the best of our understandings worship God, out of a pure mind yielding obedience to his precept, in that method which we take to be most agreeable to the Scriptures of truth, and primive pracse.</p>
<p>It would not become us to give any such inmaon, as should carry a semblance that what we do in the service of God is with a doubng conscience, or with any such temper of mind that we do thus for the present, with a reservaon that we will do otherwise hereaer upon more mature deliberaon; nor have we any cause so to do, being fully perswaded, that what we do is agreeable to the will of God. Yet we do hearly propose this, that if any of the Servants of our Lord Jesus shall, in the Spirit of meekness, aempt to convince us of any mistake either in judgement or pracse, we shall diligently ponder his arguments; and accompt him our chiefest friend that shall be an instrument to convert us from any error that is in our ways, for we cannot wingly do any thing against the truth, but all things for the truth.</p>
<p>And therefore we have indeavoured seriously to consider, what hath been already offered for our satisfaction in this point; and are loth to say any more lest we should be esteemed desirous of renewed contests thereabout: yet forasmuch as it may justly be expected that we shew some reason, why we cannot acquiesce in what hath been urged against us; we shall with as much brevity as may consist with plainness, endeavour to sasfie the expectaon of those that shall peruse what we now publish in this matter also.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to those Chrisans who consent with us, That Repentance from dead works, and Faith towards God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, is required in persons to be Baptized; and do therefore supply the defect of the (infant being uncapable of making confession of either) by others who do undertake these things for it. Although we do find by Church history that this hath been a very anent pracse; yet considering, that the same Scripture which does cauon us against censuring our brother, with whom we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, does also instruct us, That every one of us shall give an accompt of himself to God, and whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin. Rom. 14:4, 10, 12, 23. Therefore we cannot for our own parts be perswaded in our own minds, to build such a pracse as this, upon an unwrien tradion: But do rather choose in all points of Faith and Worship, to have recourse to the holy Scriptures, for the information of our judgment, and regulaon of our pracse; being well assured that a conscienous aending thereto, is the best way to prevent, and recfie our defects and errors. 2 Tim. 3. 16,17. And if any such case happen to be debated between Chrisans, which is not plainly determinable by the Scriptures, we think it safest to leave such things undecided unl the second coming of our Lord Jesus; as they did in the Church of old, unl there should arise a Priest with Urim and Thummim, that might certainly inform them of the mind of God thereabout, Ezra 2. 62, 63.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As for those our Chrisan brethren who do ground their arguments for Infants baptism, upon a presumed faederal Holiness, or ChurchMembership, we conceive they are deficient in this, that albeit this Covenant-Holiness and Membership should be as is supposed, in reference unto the Infants of Believers; yet no command for Infant baptism does immediately and directly result from such a quality, or relaon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All instuted Worship receives its sancon from the precept, and is to be thereby governed in all the necessary circumstances thereof.</p>
<p>So it was in the Covenant that God made with Abraham and his Seed. The sign whereof was appropriated only to the Male, notwithstanding that the female seed as well as the Male were comprehended in the Covenant and part of the Church of God; neither was this sign to be affixed to any Male Infant ll he was eight dayes old, albeit he was within the Covenant from the first moment of his life; nor could the danger of death, or any other supposed necessity, warrant the circumcising of him before the set me, nor was there any cause for it; the comminaon of being cut off from his people, being only upon the neglect, or contempt of the precept.</p>
<p>Righteous Lot was nearly related to Abraham in the flesh, and contemporary with him, when this Covenant was made; yet inasmuch as he did not descend from his loynes, nor was of his houshold family (although he was of the same houshold of faith with Abraham) yet neither Lot himself nor any of his posterity (because of their descent from him) were signed with the signature of this Covenant that was made with Abraham and his seed.</p>
<p>This may suffice to shew, that where there was both an expresse Covenant, and a sign thereof (such a Covenant as did separate the persons with whom it was made, and all their off-spring from all the rest of the world, as a people holy unto the Lord, and did constute them the visible Church of God, (though not comprehensive of all the faithful in the world) yet the sign of this Covenant was not affixed to all the persons that were within this Covenant, nor to any of them ll the prefixt season; nor to other faithful servants of God, that were not of descent from Abraham. And consequently that it depends purely upon the will of the Law-giver, to determine what shall be the sign of his Covenant, unto whom, at what season, and upon what terms, it shall be affixed.</p>
<p>If our brethren do suppose baptism to be the seal of the Covenant which God makes with every beleiver (of which the Scriptures are altogether silent) it is not our concern to contend with them herein; yet we conceive the seal of that Covenant is the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ in the particular and individual persons in whom he resides, and nothing else, neither do they or we suppose that baptism is in any such manner substuted in the place of circumcision, as to have the same (and no other)</p>
<p>latude, extent, or terms, then circumcision had; for that was suited only for the Male children, baptism is an ordinance suited for every beleiver, whether male, or femal. That extended to all the males that were born in Abrahams house, or bought with his money, equally with the males that proceeded from his own loynes; but baptisme is not so far extended in any true Chrisan Church that we know of, as to be administred to all the poor infidel servants, that the members thereof purchase for their service, and introduce into their families; nor to the children born of them in their house.</p>
<p>But we conceive the same parity of reasoning may hold for the ordinance of baptism as for that of circumcision; Exodus 12.49. viz. one law for the stranger, as for the home born: If any desire to be admied to all the ordinances, and priviledges of Gods house, the door is open; upon the same terms that any one person was ever admied to all, or any of those priviledges, that belong to the Chrisan Church; may all persons of right challenge the like admission.</p>
<p>As for that text of Scripture, Rom. 4. 11. He received circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised; we conceive if the Apostles scope in that place be duly aended to, it will appear that no argument can be taken from thence to inforce Infant baptism; and forasmuch as we find a full and fair account of those words given by the learned Dr. Lighfoot (a man not to be suspected of parality in this controversie) in his Hor. Hebrai, on the I Cor. 7. 19. p.42, 43. we shall transcribe his words at large, without any comment of our own upon them.</p>
<p>Circumcision is nothing, if we respect the me, for now it was without use, that end of it being especially fulfilled; for which it had been instuted: this end the Apostle declares in these words, Rom. 4.11 . But I fear that by most translaons they are not sufficiently suited to the end of circumcision, and the scope of the Apostle whilst something of their own is by them inserted.</p>
<p>And after the Doctor hath represented diverse versions of the words agreeing for the most part in sense with that which we have in our Bibles he thus proceeds.</p>
<p>Other versions are to the same purpose; as if circumcision was given to Abraham for a Seal of that Righteousness which he had being yet uncircumcised, which we will not deny to be in some sense true, but we believe that circumcision had chiefly a far different respect.</p>
<p>Give me leave thus to render the words; And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which was to be in the uncircumcision, Which was to be (I say) not which had been, not that which Abraham had whilst he was yet uncircumcised; but that which his uncircumcised seed should have, that is the Genles, who in me to come should imitate the faith of Abraham.</p>
<p>Now consider well on what occasion circumcision was instuted unto Abraham, seng before thine eyes the history thereof, Gen. 17.</p>
<p>This promise is first made unto him, Thou shalt be the Father of many Naons (in what sense the Apostle explaineth in that chapter) and then there is subjoined a double seal for the confirmation of the thing, to wit, the change of the name Abram into Abraham, and the instuon of circumcision. v4. Behold as for me, my Covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the Father of many Naons. Wherefore was his name called Abraham? for the sealing of this promise. Thou shalt be the Father of many Naons. And wherefore was circumcision instuted to him? For the sealing of the same promise. Thou shalt be the Father of many Naons. So that this is the sense of the Apostle; most agreeable to the instuon of circumcision; he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith which in me to come the uncircumcision (or the Genles) should have and obtain.</p>
<p>Abraham had a twofold seed, natural, of the Jews; and faithful, of the believing Genles: his natural seed was signed with the sign of circumcision, first indeed for the distinguishing of them from all other Naons whilst they as yet were not the seed of Abraham, but especially for the memorial of the jusfication of the Genles by faith, when at length they should become his seed. Therefore circumcision was of right to cease, when the Genles were brought in to the faith, forasmuch as then it had obtained its last and chief end, &amp; thenceforth circumcision is nothing.</p>
<p>Thus far he, which we earnestly desire may be seriously weighed, for we plead not his authority, but the evidence of truth in his words.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Of whatsoever nature the holiness of the children menoned, 1 Cor. 7. 12. be, yet they who do conclude that all such children (whether Infants or of riper years) have from hence an immediate right to baptism, do as we conceive put more into the conclusion, then will be found in the premisses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For although we do not determine posively concerning the Apostles scope in the holiness here menoned, so as to say it is this, or that, and no other thing; Yet it is evident that the Apostle does by it determine not only the lawfulness but the expedience also of a beleivers cohabitaon with an unbeliever, in the state of marriage.</p>
<p>And we do think that although the Apostles asserng of the unbelieving yokefellow to be sancfied by the believer, should carry in it somewhat more then is in the bare marriage of two infidels, because although the marriage covenant have a divine sancon so as to make the wedlock of two unbelievers a lawful acon, and their conjuncon and cohabitaon in that respect undefiled, yet there might be no ground to suppose from thence, that both or either of their persons are thereby sancfied; and the Apostle urges the cohabitaon of a believer with an infidel in the state of wedlock from this ground that the unbelieving husband is sancfied by the believing wife; nevertheless here you have the influence of a believers faith ascending from an inferior to a superior relaon; from the wife to the husband who is her head, before it can descend to their off-spring. And therefore we say, whatever be the nature or extent of the holiness here intended, we conceive it cannot convey to the children an immediate right to baptism; because it would then be of another nature, and of a larger extent, then the root, and original from whence it is derived, for it is clear by the Apostles argument that holiness cannot be derived to the child from the sancty of one parent only, if either father or mother be (in the sense intended by the Apostle) unholy or unclean, so will the child be also, therefore for the producon of an holy seed it is necessary that both the Parents be sancfied; and this the Apostle posively asserts in the first place to be done by the beleiving parent, although the other be an unbeliever; and then consequenally from thence argues, the holiness of their children. Hence it follows, that as the children have no other holiness then what they derive from both their Parents; so neither can they have any right by this holiness to any spiritual priviledge but such as both their Parents did also partake of: and therefore if the unbelieving Parent (though sancfied by the believing Parent) have not thereby a right to baptism, neither can we concieve, that there is any such priviledge, derived to the children by their birth-holiness.</p>
<p>Besides if it had been the usual pracce in the Apostles dayes for the father or mother that did beleive, to bring all their children with them to be bapsed; then the holiness of the beleiving Corinthians children, would not at all have been in queson when this Epistle was wrien; but might have been argued from their passing under that ordinance, which represented their new birth, although they had derived no holiness from their Parents, by their first birth; and would have layen as an excepon against the Apostles inference, else were your Children unclean, &amp;c. But of the sanctification of all the children of every beleiver by this ordinance, or any other way, then what is beforemenoned, the Scripture is altogether silent.</p>
<p>This may also be added; that if this birth holiness do qualifie all the children of every believer, for the ordinance of baptism; why not for all other ordinances? for the Lords Supper as was pracced for a long me together? for if recourse be had to what the Scriptures speak generally of this subject; it will be found, that the same qualies which do intle any person to baptism, do so also for the parcipaon of all the Ordinances, and priviledges of the house of God, that are common to all believers.</p>
<p>Whosoever can and does interrogate his good Conscience towards God when he is bapsed (as every one must do that makes it to himself a sign of salvation) is capable of doing the same thing, in every other act of worship that he performs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The arguments and inferences that are usually brought for, or against Infant baptism from those few instances which the Scriptures afford us of whole families being bapsed; are only conjectural; and therefore cannot of themselves, be conclusive on either hand: yet in regard most that treat on this subject for Infant baptism, do (as they conceive) improve these</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>instances to the advantage of their argument: we think it meet (in like manner as in the cases before menoned so in this) to shew the invalidity of such inferences.</p>
<p>Cornelius worshipped God with all his house, the Jaylor, and Crispus the chief ruler of the Synagogue, believed God with each of their houses. The houshold of Stephanus addicted themselves to the Ministry of the Saints: so that thus far Worshipping, and Believing runs parallel with Baptism. And if Lydia, had been a married person, when she believed, it is probable her husband would also have been named by the Apostle, as in like cases, inasmuch as he would have been not only a part, but the head of that bapsed houshold.</p>
<p>Who can assign any probable reason, why the Apostle should make menon of four or five housholds being bapsed and no more? or why he does so oen vary in the method of his salutaons, Rom. 1. 6. somemes menoning only particular persons of great note, other mes such, and the Church in their house? the Saints that were with them; and them belonging to Narcissus, who were in the Lord; thus salung either whole families, or part of families, or only particular persons in families, considered as they were in the Lord, for if it had been an usual pracse to bapze all children, with their parents; there were then many thousands of the Jews which believed, and a great number of the Genles, in most of the principle Cies in the World, and among so many thousands, it is more then probable there would have been some thousands of housholds bapsed; why then should the Apostle in this respect signalize one family of the Jews and three or four of the Genles, as particular instances in a case that was common? whoever supposes that we do willfully debar our children, from the benefit of any promise, or priviledge, that of right belongs to the children of believing parents; they do entertain over severe thoughts of us: to be without natural affecons is one of the characters of the worst of persons; in the worst of mes. Wee do freely confesse our selves guilty before the Lord, in that we have not with more circumspecon and diligence train'd up those that relate to us in the fear of the Lord; and do humbly and earnestly pray, that our omissions herein may be remied, and that they may not redound to the prejudice of our selves, or any of ours: but with respect to that duty that is incumbent on us, we acknowledge our selves obliged by the precepts of God, to bring up our children in the nurture and admonion of the Lord, to teach them his fear, both by instrucon and example; and should we set light by this precept, it would demonstrate that we are more vile then the unnatural Heathen, that like not to retain God in their knowledge, our baptism might then be justly accompted, as no baptism to us.</p>
<p>There are many special promises that do incourage us as well as precepts, that do oblige us to the close pursuit of our duty herein: that God whom we serve, being jealous of his Worship, threatens the vising of the Fathers transgression upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him: yet does more abundantly extend his mercy, even to thousands (respecng the offspring and succeding generations) of them that love him, and keep his commands.</p>
<p>When our Lord rebuked his disciples for prohibing the access of little children that were brought to him, that he might pray over them, lay his hands upon them, and blesse them, does declare, that of such is the Kingdom of God. And the Apostle Peter in answer to their enquiry, that desired to know what they must do to be saved, does not only instruct them in the necessary duty of repentance and baptism; but does also thereto encourage them, by that promise which had reference both to them, and their children; if our Lord Jesus in the foremenoned place, do not respect the qualies of children (as elsewhere) as to their meekness, humility, and sincerity, and the like; but intend also that those very persons and such like, appertain to the Kingdom of God, and if the Apostle Peter in menoning the aforesaid promise, do respect not only the present and succeeding generations of those Jews, that heard him, (in which sense the same phrase doth occurre in Scripture) but also the immediate off-spring of his auditors; whether the promise relate to the gi of the Holy Spirit, or of eternal life, or any grace, or priviledge tending to the obtaining thereof; it is neither our concerne nor our interest to confine the mercies, and promises of God, to a more narrow, or lesse compasse then he is pleased graously to offer and intend them; nor to have a light esteem of them; but are obliged in duty to God, and affecon to our children; to plead earnestly with God and use our utmost endeavours that both our selves, and our off-spring may be partakers of his Mercies and gracious Promises: yet we cannot from either of these texts collect a sufficient warrant for us to bapze our children before they are instructed in the principles of the Chrisan Religion.</p>
<p>For as to the instance in little children, it seems by the disciples forbidding them, that they were brought upon some other account, not so frequent as Baptism must be supposed to have been, if from the beginning believers children had been admied thereto: and no account is given whether their parents were bapsed believers or not; and as to the instance of the Apostle; if the following words and pracce, may be taken as an interpretaon of the scope of that promise we cannot conceive it does refer to infant baptism, because the text does presently subjoyn; Then they that gladly received the word were bapsed.</p>
<p>That there were some believing children of believing parents in the Apostles dayes is evident from the Scriptures, even such as were then in ther fathers family, and under their parents tuion, and educaon; to whom the Apostle in several of his Epistles to the Churches, giveth commands to obey their parents in the Lord; and does allure their tender years to hearken to this precept, by reminding them that it is the first command with promise.</p>
<p>And it is recorded by him for the praise of Timothy, and encouragement of parents bemes to instaruct, and children early to aend to godly instrucon, that from a child, he had known the holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>The Apostle John rejoyced greatly when he found of the children of the Elect Lady walking in the truth; and the children of her Elect Sister joyn with the Apostle in his salutaon.</p>
<p>But that this was not generally so, that all the children of believers were accounted for believers (as they would have been if they had been all bapsed) may be collected from the character which the Apostle gives of persons fit to be chosen to Eldership in the Church which was not common to all believers; among others this is expressely one, viz. If there be any having believing, or faithful children, not accused of Riot or unruly; and we may from the Apostles wrings on the same subject collect the reason of this qualificaon, viz. That in case the person designed for this office to teach and rule in the house of God, had children capable of it; there might be first a proof of his ability, industry, and successe in this work in his own family; and private capacity, before he was ordained to the exercise of this authority in the Church, in a publick capacity, as a Bishop in the house of God.</p>
<p>These things we have menoned as having a direct reference unto the controversie between our brethren and us; other things that are more abstruse and prolix, which are frequently introduced into this controversie, but do not necessarily concern it, we have purposely avoided; that the distance between us and our brethren may not be by us made more wide; for it is our duty, and concern so far as is possible for us (retaining a good conscience towards God) to seek a more enre agreement and reconciliaon with them.</p>
<p>We are not insenible that as to the order of Gods house, and enre communion therein there are some things wherein we (as well as others) are not at a full accord among our selves, as for instance; the known principle, and state of the consciences of diverse of us, that have agreed in this Confession is such; that we cannot hold Church-communion, with any other then Baptized-believers, and Churches constuted of such; yet some others of us have a greater liberty and freedom in our spirits that way; and therefore we have purposely omied the menon of things of that nature, that we might concurre, in giving this evidence of our agreement, both among our selves, and with other good Chrisans, in those important articles of the Chrisan Religion, mainly insisted on by us: and this notwithstanding we all esteem it our chief concern, both among our selves, and all others that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours, and love him in sincerity, to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; and in order thereunto, to exercise all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love.</p>
<p>And we are perswaded if the same method were introduced into frequent pracce between us and our Chrisan friends who agree with us in all the fundamental articles of the Chrisan faith (though they do not so in the subject and administraon of baptism) it would soon beget a beer understanding, and brotherly affecon between us.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Chrisan Church, when the doctrine of the baptism of Christ was not universally understood, yet those that knew only the baptism of John, were the Disciples of the Lord Jesus; and Apollos an eminent Minister of the Gospel of Jesus.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the reformaon of the Chrisan Church, and recovery from that Egypan darkness wherein our forefathers for many generations were held in bondage; upon recourse had to the Scriptures of truth, different apprehensions were conceived, which are to this me connued, concerning the pracse of this Ordinance.</p>
<p>Let not our zeal herein be misinterpreted: that God whom we serve is jealous of his worship. By his gracious providence the Law thereof, is connued amongst us; and we are forewarned by what hapned in the Church of the Jews, that it is necessary for every generation, and that frequently in every generation to consult the divine oracle, compare our worship with the rule, and take heed to what doctrines we receive and pracse.</p>
<p>If the ten commands exhibited in the popish Idolatrous service books had been received as the enre law of God, because they agree in number with his ten commands, and also in the substance of nine of them; the second Commandment forbidding Idolatry had been uerly lost.</p>
<p>If Ezra and Nehemiah had not made a diligent search into the particular parts of Gods law, and his worship; the Feast of Tabernacles (which for many centuries of years, had not been duly observed, according to the instuon, though it was retained in the general noon) would not have been kept in due order.</p>
<p>So may it be now as to many things relang to the service of God, which do retain the names proper to them in their first instuon, but yet through inadvertency (where there is no sinister design) may vary in their circumstances, from their first instuon. And if by means of any anent defecon, or of that general corrupon of the service of God, and interrupon of his true worship, and persecution of his servants by the Anchrisan Bishop of Rome, for many generations; those who do consult the Word of God, cannot yet arrive at a full and mutual satisfaction among themselves, what was the pracse of the primive Chrisan Church, in some points relang to the Worship of God: yet inasmuch as these things are not of the essence of Chrisanity, but that we agree in the fundamental doctrines thereof, we do apprehend, there is sufficient ground to lay aside all bierness and prejudice, and in the spirit of love and meekness to imbrace and own each other therein; leaving each other at liberty to perform such other services, (wherein we cannot concur) apart unto God, according to the best of our understanding.</p>
