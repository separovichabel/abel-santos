<h2 id="a-short-history-of-the-creeds-and-confessions">A Short History of the Creeds and Confessions<a class="headerlink" href="#a-short-history-of-the-creeds-and-confessions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It is asserted in the first chapter of this Confession [The Westminster Confession  of  Faith],  and  vindicated  in  this  exposition  that  the Scriptures  of  the  Old  and  New  Testaments,  having  been  given  by inspiration of God, are for man in his present state the only and the all-sufficient  rule  of  faith  and  practice.  All  that  man  is  to  believe concerning God, and the entire duty which God requires of man, are revealed therein, and  are to be believed and  obeyed  because contained therein, because it is the word of God. This divine word, therefore,  is the  only  standard  of  doctrine  which  has  intrinsic authority binding the conscience of men. And all other standards are of  value  or  authority  only  in  proportion  as  they  teach  what  the Scriptures teach.</p>
<p>While, however, the Scriptures are from God, the understanding of them belongs to the part of men. Men must interpret to the best of their  ability  each  particular  part  of  Scripture  separately,  and  then combine  all  that  the  Scriptures  teach  upon  every  subject  into  a consistent  whole,  and  then  adjust  their  teachings  upon  different subjects  in  mutual  consistency  as  parts  of  a  harmonious  system. Every student of the Bible must do this, and all make it obvious that they  do  it  by  the  terms  they  use  in  their  prayers  and  religious discourse, whether they admit or deny the propriety of human creeds and  confessions.  If they refuse the assistance afforded  by  the statements of doctrine slowly elaborated and defined by the Church, they must make out their own creed by their own unaided wisdom. The  real  question  is  not,  as  often  pretended,  between  the  word  of God and the creed of man, but between the tried and proved faith of the collective body of God's people, and the private judgment and the unassisted wisdom of the repudiator of creeds.</p>
<p>As we would have anticipated, it is a matter of fact that the Church has advanced very gradually in this work of the accurate interpretation  of  Scripture  and  definition  of  the  great  doctrines which compose the system of truth it reveals.  The  attention  of  the Church has been  specially  directed  to  the  study  of  one  doctrine  in one age, and of another doctrine in another age. And as she has thus gradually  advanced  in  the  clear  discrimination  of  gospel  truth,  she has at different periods set down an accurate statement of the results of  her  new  attainments  in  a  Creed  or  Confession  of  Faith,  for  the purpose of preservation and popular instruction. In the mean time, heretics spring up on all occasions, who pervert the Scriptures, who exaggerate  certain  aspects  of  the  truth  and  deny  others  equally essential,  and  thus  in  effect  turn  the  truth  of  God  into  a  lie.  The Church is forced, therefore, on the great principle of selfpreservation,  to  form  such  accurate  definitions  of  every  particular doctrine misrepresented as shall include the whole truth and exclude all error, and to make such comprehensive exhibitions of the system of revealed truth as a whole that no one part shall be either unduly diminished or exaggerated, but the true proportion of the whole be preserved. At the same time, provision must be made for ecclesiastical discipline, and to secure the real co-operation of those who  profess  to  work  together  in  the  same  cause,  so  that  public teachers  in  the  same  communion  may  not  contradict  one  another, and  the  one  pull  down  what  the  other  is  striving  to  build  up. Formularies must also be prepared, representing as far as possible the  common  consent,  and  clothed  with  public  authority,  for  the instruction  of  the  members  of  the  Church,  and  especially  of  the children.</p>
<p>Creeds and Confessions, therefore, have been found necessary in all ages and branches of the Church, and, when not abused, have been useful  for  the  following  purposes:  (1.)  To  mark,  disseminate  and preserve the attainments made in the knowledge of Christian truth by any branch of the Church in any crisis of its development. (2.) To discriminate  the  truth  from  the  glosses  of  false  teachers,  and  to present it in its integrity and due proportions. (3.) To act as the basis of  ecclesiastical  fellowship  among  those  so  nearly  agreed  as  to  be able to labor together in harmony. (4.) To be used as instruments in the great work of popular instruction.</p>
<p>It  must  be  remembered,  however,  that  the  matter  of  these  Creeds and  Confessions  binds  the  consciences  of  men  only  so  far  as  it  is purely scriptural, and because it is so; and as to the form in which that  matter  is  stated,  they  bind  those  only  who  have  voluntarily subscribed the Confession, and because of that subscription.</p>
<p>In all churches a distinction is made between the terms upon which private members are admitted to membership, and the terms upon which office-bearers are admitted to their sacred trusts of teaching and ruling. A Church has no right to make anything a condition of membership which Christ has not made a condition of salvation. The Church is Christ's fold. The sacraments are the seals of his covenant. All have a right to claim admittance who make a credible profession of  the  true  religion-that  is,  who  are  presumptively  the  people  of Christ.  This  credible  profession  of  course  involves  a  competent knowledge of the fundamental doctrine of Christianity-a declaration of  personal  faith  in  Christ  and  consecration  to  his  service,  and  a temper of mind and habit consistent therewith. On the other hand, no man can be inducted into any office in any Church who does not protest  to  believe  in  the  truth  and  wisdom  of  the  constitution  and laws which it will be his duty to conserve and administer. Otherwise all  harmony  of  sentiment  and  all  efficient  co-operation  in  action would be impossible.</p>
<p>The original Synod of our American Presbyterian Church in the year 1729  solemnly  adopted  the  Westminster  Confession  of  Faith  and Catechisms as the doctrinal standards of the Church. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>'All the ministers of the Synod now present, which were eighteen in number,  except  one,  that  declared  himself  not  prepared,  [but  who gave his assent at the next meeting], after proposing all the scruples any of them had to make against any articles and expressions in the Confession  of  Faith,  and  Larger  and  Shorter  Catechisms  of  the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, have unanimously agreed in the solution of those scruples, and in declaring the said Confession and Catechisms  to  be  the  Confession  of  their  Faith,  except  only  some clauses in the twentieth and twenty-third chapters, 'Concerning the Civil Magistrate.''</p>
<p>Again, in the year 1788, preparatory to the formation of the General Assembly,  'the  Synod,  having  fully  considered  the  draught  of  the Form of Government and Discipline, did, on review of the whole, and hereby do, ratify and adopt the same, as now altered and amended, as the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church in America, and order the same to be considered and strictly observed as the rule of their proceedings, by all the inferior judicatories belonging to the body.</p>
<p>'The  Synod,  having  now  revised  and  corrected  the  draught  of  a Directory  for  Worship,  did  approve  and  ratify  the  same,  and  do hereby  appoint  the  same  Directory,  as  now  amended,  to  be  the Directory for the worship of God in the Presbyterian Church in the United  States  of  America.  They  also  took  into  consideration  the Westminster  Larger  and  Shorter  Catechisms,  and,  having  made  a small amendment of the Larger, did approve and do hereby approve and ratify the said Catechisms, as now agreed on, as the Catechisms of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. And the Synod order that the Directory and Catechisms be printed and bound up in the same  volume  with  the Confession of Faith and the Form  of Government  and  Discipline;  that  the  whole  be  considered  as  the standard  of our doctrine, government,  discipline  and  worship, agreeably to the resolutions of the Synod it their present session.'</p>
<p>What  follows  is  a  very  brief  and  general  history  of  the  principal Creeds  and  Confessions  of  the  several  branches  of  the  Christian Church. In this statement they are grouped according to the order of time and the churches which adhere to them:</p>
<h2 id="i-the-ancient-creeds-which-express-the-common-faith-of-the-whole-church">I. The ancient Creeds, which express the common faith of the whole Church.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-the-ancient-creeds-which-express-the-common-faith-of-the-whole-church" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Creeds formed before the Reformation are very few, relate to the fundamental principles of Christianity, especially the Trinity and the Person of the God-man, and are the common heritage of the whole Church.</p>
<p>1st.  The  Apostles'  Creed .  This  was  not  written  by  the  apostles,  but was gradually formed, by common consent, out of the Confessions adopted severally by particular churches, and used in the reception of its members. It reached its present form, and universal use among all  the  churches,  about  the  close  of  the  second  century.  This  Creed was  appended  to  the  Shorter  Catechism,  together  with  the  Lord's Prayer  and  Ten  Commandments,  in  the  first  edition  published  by order  of  Parliament,  'not  as  though  it  were  composed  by  the apostles,  or  ought  to  be  esteemed  canonical  Scripture,  .  .  .  but because it is a brief sum of Christian faith, agreeable to the Word of God,  and  anciently  received  in  the  churches  of  Christ.'  It  was retained by the framers of our Constitution as part of the Catechism. 1 It is as follows:</p>
<p>'I  believe  in  God  the  Father  Almighty,  Maker  of  heaven  and earth;  and  in  Jesus  Christ  his  only  Son  our  Lord;  who  was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under  Pontius  Pilate, was  crucified, dead, and  buried; he descended into hell  (Hades);  the  third  day  he  rose  again  from the dead, he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the  quick  and  the  dead.  I  believe  in  the  Holy  Ghost;  the  Holy Catholic  Church;  the  communion  of  saints,  the  forgiveness  of sins;  the  resurrection  of  the  body;  and  the  life  everlasting. Amen.'</p>
<p>2d.  The  Nicene  Creed. This  Creed  is  formed  on  the  basis  of  the Apostles' Creed, the clauses relating to the consubstantial divinity of Christ  being  contributed  by  the  great  Council  held  in  Nice  in Bithynia, A.D. 325, and those relating to the divinity and personality of the Holy Ghost added by the Second Ecumenical Council, held at Constantinople,  A.D.381;  and  the  'filioque'  clause  added  by  the Council of the Western Church, held at Toledo, Spain, A.D. 569. In its  present  form  it  is  the  Creed  of  the  whole  Christian  Church,  the Greek Church rejecting only the last added clause. It is as follows:</p>
<p>'I believe in one God, Maker of heaven and earth, and all things visible  and  invisible;  and  in  one  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  Only begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds;</p>
<p>God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made,  being  of  one  substance  with  the  Father;  by  whom  all things were made; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried; and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he shall come  again  with  glory  to  judge  both  the  quick  and  the  dead; whose  kingdom  shall  have  no  end.  And  I  believe  in  the  Holy Ghost,  the  Lord  the  Giver  of  life,  who  proeeedeth  from  the Father and the Son (filioque), who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spake by the prophets. And I believe in one Catholic and Apostolic Church; I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for  the  resurrection  of  the  dead  and  the  life  of  the  world  to come.'</p>
<p>3d. As subsequently heretical opinions sprang up in its bosom with respect  to  the  constitution  of  the  person  of  Christ,  the  Church was forced to provide additional definitions and muniments of the truth. One heretical tendency culminated in Nestorianism, which maintains that the divine and human natures in Christ constitute two persons.  This  was  condemned  by  the  Creed  of  the  Council  of Ephesus,  A.D.  431.  The  opposite  heretical  tendency  culminated  in Eutychianism, which maintains that the divine and human natures are  so united  in  Christ  as  to form  but  one  nature.  This  was condemned  by  the  Council  of  Chalcedon,  A.D.  451.  These  Creeds, defining  the  faith  of  the  Church  as  embracing two  natures  in  one person ,  are  received  and  approved  by  the  entire  Church.  They  are sufficiently quoted in the body of the following 'Commentary.'</p>
<p>4th. The Athanasian Creed. This Creed was evidently composed long after the death of the great theologian whose name it bears, and after the controversies closed and the definitions established by the abovementioned  Councils  of  Ephesus  and  Chalcedon.  It  is  a  grand  and unique monument of the unchangeable faith of the whole Church as to the great mysteries of godliness, the Trinity of Persons in the one God and the  duality  of  natures  in  the  one  Christ.  It  is  too  long  to quote here in full. What relates to the Person of the God-man is as follows:</p>
<p>'27. But it is necessary to eternal salvation that he should  also faithfully believe in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. 28. It  is  therefore  true  faith  that  we  believe  and  confess  that  our Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  both  God  and  man.  29.  He  is  God; generated from eternity from the substance of the Father; man born in time from the substance of his Mother. 30. Perfect God, perfect man, subsisting of a rational soul and human flesh. 31. Equal  to  the  Father  in  respect  to  his  divinity,  less  than  the Father in respect to his humanity. 32. Who, although he is God and man, is not two, but one Christ. 33. But two not from the conversion of divinity into flesh, but from the assumption of his humanity  into  God.  34.  One  not  at  all  from  confusion  of substance, but from unity of Person. 35. For as rational soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ,' etc.</p>
<h2 id="ii-the-creeds-and-confessions-of-the-different-branches-of-the-church-since-the-reformation">II. The Creeds and Confessions of the different branches of the Church since the Reformation.<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-the-creeds-and-confessions-of-the-different-branches-of-the-church-since-the-reformation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>1st. The Doctrinal Standards of the Church of Rome .</p>
<p>In order to oppose the progress of the Reformation, Pope Paul III. called  the  last  great  ecumenical  Council  at  Trent  (1545-1563).  The deliverances  of  this  Council,  entitled  Canons  and  Decrees  of  the Council  of  Trent,  form  the  highest  doctrinal  rule  known  to  that Church. The decrees contain the positive statements of doctrine The canons explain the decrees, distribute the matter under brief heads and condemn the opposing of Protestant doctrine on each point.</p>
<p>The  Roman Catechism, which explains  and  enforces  the  canons  of the Council of Trent, was prepared and promulgated by the authority of Pope Pius IV., AD. 1556.</p>
<p>The  Tridentine  Confession  of  Faith  was  also  imposed  upon  all  the priests  and  candidates  of  the  Romish  Church  and  converts  from other churches.</p>
<p>In addition to these, different papal bulls and some private writings have been authoritatively set up as standards of the true faith by the authority of popes; e.g., the Catechism of Bellarmine, A.D. 1603, and the bull Unigenitus of Clement XI., 1711.</p>
<p>The theology taught in all these papal standards is Arminianism.</p>
<p>2d. The Doctrinal Standards of the Greek Church .</p>
<p>The  ancient  Church  divided  from  causes  primarily  political  and ecclesiastical, secondarily doctrinal and ritual, into two great sections -the  Eastern  or  Greek  Church,  and  the  Western  or  Latin  Church. This division began to culminate in the seventh, and was consummated in the eleventh century. The Greek Church embraces Greece, the majority of the Christians of the Turkish Empire and the great mass of the civilized inhabitants of Russia. All the Protestant churches have originated through the Reformation from the Western or Roman Church.</p>
<p>This  Church  arrogates  to  herself  pre-eminently  the  title  of  the 'orthodox,' because the original creeds defining the doctrine of the Trinity and the Person of Christ, which have been mentioned above, were produced in the Eastern half of the ancient Church, and hence are  in  a  peculiar  sense  her  inheritance.  Greek  theology  is  very imperfectly developed beyond the ground covered by these ancient creeds,  which  that  Church  magnifies  and  maintains  with  singular tenacity.</p>
<p>They possess also a few confessions of more modern date, as 'The Orthodox  Confession'  of  Peter  Mogilas,  A.D.  1642,  metropolitan bishop of Kiew, the Confession of Gennadius, A.D. 1453.</p>
<h2 id="3d-the-confessions-of-the-lutheran-church">3d. The Confessions of the Lutheran Church .<a class="headerlink" href="#3d-the-confessions-of-the-lutheran-church" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The  entire  Protestant  world  from  the  time  of  the  Reformation  has been divided into two great families of churches-the LUTHERAN, including all those which received their characteristic impress from the great man whose name they bear; the REFORMED, including all those, on the other hand, which derived their character from Calvin.</p>
<p>The Lutheran family of churches embraces all those Protestants  of Germany  and  the  Baltic  provinces  of  Russia  who  adhere  to  the Augsburg Confession, together with the national churches of Denmark,  of  Norway  and  Sweden,  and  the  large  denomination  of that name in America.</p>
<h2 id="their-symbolical-books-are">Their Symbolical Books are:<a class="headerlink" href="#their-symbolical-books-are" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Augsburg  Confession,  the  joint  authors  of  which  were Luther and Melancthon. Having been signed by the Protestant princes  and  leaders,  it  was  presented  to  the  emperor  and imperial Diet in Augsburg A.D. 1530. It is the oldest Protestant confession, the ultimate basis of Lutheran theology, and the only universally accepted standard of the Lutheran churches.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Apology (Defence) of the Augsburg Confession, prepared by Melancthon A.D. 1530, and subscribed by the Protestant theologians A.D. 1537 at Smalcald.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Larger  and  Smaller  Catechisms,  prepared  by  Luther  A.D. 1529, 'the first for the use of preachers and teachers, the last as a guide in the instruction of youth.'</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Articles  of  Smalcald,  drawn  up  by  Luther  A.D.  1535,  and subscribed  by  the  evangelical  theologians  in  February,  A.D.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1537, at the place whose name they hear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Formula Concordiae (Form of Concord), prepared in A.D. 1577  by  Andrea  and  others  for  the  purpose  of  settling  certain controversies  which  had  sprung  up  in  the  Lutheran  Church, especially concerning the relative activities of divine grace and the human will in regeneration, and concerning the nature of the Lord's  presence  in  the  Eucharist.  This  confession  contains  a more  scientific  and  thoroughly  developed  statement  of  the Lutheran doctrine than can be found in any other of their public symbols.  Its  authority  is,  however,  acknowledged  only  by  the high Lutheran party; that is, by that party in the Church which consistently carries the peculiarities of Lutheran theology out to the most complete logical development.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4th. The Confessions of the Reformed or Calvinistic churches.</p>
<p>The  Reformed  churches  embrace  all  those  churches  of  Germany which subscribe the Heidelberg Catechism; the Protestant churches of Switzerland, France, Holland, England and Scotland: the Independents and Baptists of England and America, and the various branches of the Presbyterian Church in England and America.</p>
<p>The  Reformed  Confessions  are  very  numerous,  although  they  all substantially  agree  as  to  the  system  of  doctrine  they  teach.  Those most generally received,  and  regarded  as  of  the  highest  symbolical authority as standards of the common system, are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Second  Helvetic  Confession,  prepared  by  Bullinger,  A.D. 1564. 'It was adopted by all the Reformed churches in Switzerland, with the exception of Basle (which was content with its old symbol,  the First Helvetic), and  by the Reformed churches in Poland, Hungary, Scotland and France,' 2 and has always  been  regarded  as  of  the  highest  authority  by  all  the Reformed churches.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Heidelberg Catechism, prepared by Ursinus and Olevianus, A.D.  1562.  It  was  established  by  civil  authority,  the  doctrinal</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>standard, as well  as  instrument  of  religious  instruction  for  the churches of the Palatinate, a German State at that time including both banks of the Rhine. It was endorsed by the Synod of Dort, and  is  the  Confession  of  Faith  of  the  Reformed  churches  of Germany and Holland, and of the German and Dutch Reformed churches in America.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. These were originally  drawn  up  by  Cranmer  and  Ridley,  A.D.  1551,  and revised  and  reduced  to  the  present  number  by  the  bishops,  at the  order  of  Queen  Elizabeth,  A.D.  1562.  These  Articles  are Calvinistic in doctrine, and constitute the doctrinal standard of the  Episcopal  churches in England, Scotland,  America  and  the Colonies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Canons  of  the  Synod  of  Dort.  This  famous  Synod  was convened  in  Dort,  Holland,  by  the  authority  of  the  States General, for the purpose of settling the questions brought into controversy  by  the  disciples  of  Arminius.  It  held  its  sessions from November 13, A.D. 1618, to May 9, A.D. 1619. It consisted of pastors, elders and theological professors from the churches of Holland, and deputies from the churches of England, Scotland,  Hesse,  Bremen,  the  Palatinate  and  Switzerland;  the French delegates having been prevented from being present by order of their king. The Canons of this Synod were received by all  the  Reformed  churches  as  a  true,  accurate  and  eminently authoritative  exhibition  of  the  Calvinistic  System  of  Theology. They constitute,  in  connection  with  the  Heidelberg  Catechism, the  doctrinal  Confession  of  the  Reformed  Church  of  Holland, and of the [Dutch] Reformed Church of America.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Confession and Catechisms of the Westminster Assembly. A short  account  of  the  origin  and  constitution  of  this  Assembly, and of the production and reception of its doctrinal deliverances,  is  presented  in  the  next  chapter.  This  is  the common doctrinal standard of all the Presbyterian churches in the  world  of  English  and  Scotch  derivation.  It  is  also  of  all Creeds  the  one  most  highly  approved  by  all  the  bodies  of Congregationalists in England and America. The Congregational</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Convention  called  by  Cromwell  to  meet  at  Savoy,  in  London, A.D.  1658,  declared  their  approval  of  the  doctrinal  part  of  the Confession  and  Catechisms  of  the  Westminster  Assembly,  and conformed  their  own  deliverance,  the  Savoy  Confession,  very nearly to it. Indeed, 'the difference between these two Confessions  is  so  very  small,  that  the  modern  Independents have in a manner laid aside the use of it (Savoy Conf.) in their families,  and  agreed  with  the  Presbyterians  in  the  use  of  the Assembly's Catechisms.' 3 All the Assemblies convened in New England for the purpose of settling the doctrinal basis of their churches have either endorsed or explicitly adopted this Confession and these Catechisms as accurate expositions of their own faith. This was done by the Synod which met at Cambridge, Massachusetts, June, 1647, and again August, 1648, and prepared  the  Cambridge  Platform.  And  again  by  the  Synod which  sat  in  Boston,  September,  1679,  and  May,  1680,  and produced the Boston Confession. And again by the Synod which met at Saybrook, Connecticut, 1708, and produced the Saybrook Platform. 4</p>

<h2 id="some-account-of-the-origin-of-the-westminster-confession-and-catechisms">Some Account of the Origin of the Westminster Confession and Catechisms<a class="headerlink" href="#some-account-of-the-origin-of-the-westminster-confession-and-catechisms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Most  of  the  Confessions  of  the  Reformed  and  Lutheran  churches were composed by single authors, or by a small group of theologians to  whom  the  task  of  drawing  up  a  standard  of  doctrine  had  been committed. Thus, Luther and Melancthon were the principal authors of the Augsburg Confession, the common standard of faith and bond of union of the Lutheran churches. The Second Helvetic Confession was composed by Bullinger, to whom the work was entrusted by a number of Swiss theologians; and the celebrated Heidelberg Catechism was composed by Ursinus and Olevianus, who had been appointed thereto by Frederick III., Crown Prince of the Palatinate. The Old Scotch Confession, which was the standard of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland for nearly one hundred years before the  adoption  of  the  Westminster  Confession,  was  composed  by  a committee of six theologians, at the head of whom was John Knox, appointed by the Scottish Parliament. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church  of  England  and  of  the  Episcopal  Church  of  America  were prepared by the bishops of that Church in 1562, as the result of the revision of "The Forty-two Articles of Edward Sixth," which had been drawn  up  by  Archbishop  Cranmer  and  Bishop  Ridley  in  1551.  The "Canons  of  the  Synod  of  Dort,"  of  high  authority  among  all  the Reformed  churches,  and  the  Standard  of  the  Church  of  Holland, were  on  the  other  hand  drawn  up  by  a  great  international  Synod convened  in  Dort  by  the  States  General  of  the  Netherlands,  and composed  of  representatives  of  all  the  Reformed  churches  except that of France. And the Confession of Faith</p>
<p>and  Catechisms  of  our  Church  were  drawn  up  by  a  large  and illustrious  national  assembly  of  divines  and  civilians  convened  in Westminster, England, by the Long Parliament from Jul 1, 1643, to Feb 22, 1648; a very brief account of which it  is  the  design  of  this chapter to give.</p>
<p>The Reformation in Scotland had received its first impulse from the return  of  the  illustrious  Patrick  Hamilton,  in  AD  1528,  from  the Continent,  where  he  had  enjoyed  the  instructions  of  Luther  and Melancthon.  It  was  in  no  degree  a  political  revolution,  nor  did  it originate  with  the  governing  classes.  It  was  purely  a  religious revolution, wrought among the masses of the people and the body of the  Church  itself,  under  the  direction  at  different  times  of  several very  eminent  leaders,  the  chief  of  whom  were  John  Knox  and Andrew Melville. "The Church of Scotland framed its Confession of Faith  and  its  First  Book  of  Discipline,  and  met  in  its  first  General Assembly  for  its  own  government,  seven  years  before  it  had  even received  the  sanction  of  the  legislature.  Its  first  General  Assembly was held in AD 1560, while the first Act of Parliament recognizing it as  the  National  Church was passed in AD 1567."[1] It continued to maintain in a good degree its independence of civil dictation and its integrity  as  a  Presbyterian  Church  until  after  King  James  assumed the  throne  of  England.  After  that  time,  through  English  influence and  the  increased  power  of  the  throne,  the  independence  of  the</p>
<p>Church of Scotland was often temporarily destroyed. In resistance to this invasion of their religious liberties, the friends of liberty and of the Reformed religion among the Scotch nobility, clergy and people, signed  the  ever-memorable  National  Covenant  at  Sterling,  Feb  28, 1638, and the Solemn League and Covenant between the kingdoms of  England  and  Scotland  in  AD  1643.  "This  Solemn  League  and Covenant (subscribed by the Scotch General Assembly, the English Parliament and Westminster Assembly) bound the united kingdoms to endeavour  the  preservation  of  the  Reformed  religion  in  the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, worship, discipline and government, and  the  reformation  of  religion  in  the  kingdoms  of  England  and Ireland, according to the Word of God and the example of the best Reformed churches."[2] It was in furtherance of the  same  design  of  securing  in  both  kingdoms  religious  liberty,  a more  perfect  reformation  and  ecclesiastical  uniformity,  that  the Scotch  people  gave  the  effective  support  of  their  sympathy  to  the English  Parliament  in  their  struggle  with  Charles  I.,  and  that  the Scottish  Church  sent  her  most  eminent  sons  as  delegates  to  the Westminster Assembly.</p>
<p>The Reformation in England presents two distinct phases-that of a genuine  work  of  grace,  and  that  of  a  political  and  ecclesiastical revolution. In the former character it was  introduced by the publication  of  the  Word  of  God,  the  Greek  Testament  of  Erasmus, published in Oxford, 1517, and the English translation of the Bible by Tyndal, which was sent over from Worms to England in 1526. By the English  Bible,  together  with  the  labours  of  many  truly  pious  men both among the clergy and laity, a thoroughly popular revolution was wrought  in  the  religion  of  the  nation,  and  its heart  rendered permanently  Protestant.  The  real  Reformers  of  England,  such  as Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, Latimer and Jewell, were truly evangelical and thoroughly Calvinistic, in full sympathy and constant correspondence with the great theologians and preachers of Switzerland and Germany. This is illustrated in their writings, in the Forty-two  Articles  of  Edward  VI.,  AD  1551,  the  present  doctrinal</p>
<p>Articles of the Church of England, prepared in AD 1562, and even in the Lambeth Articles, drawn up by Archbishop Whitgift as late as AD 1595.</p>
<p>Although this work of genuine reformation was in the first instance materially  aided  by  the  politico-ecclesiastical  revolution  introduced by Henry VIII. and confirmed by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth, it was  nevertheless  greatly  impeded  and  prematurely  arrested  by  it. "The Act of Supremacy," which made the sovereign the earthly head of the Church, and subjected all questions of doctrine, church order and discipline to his absolute control, enabled Elizabeth to arrest the constitutional changes in the Church set up by the process of reform at that precise point which was determined by her worldly taste and her lust of power. An aristocratic hierarchy naturally sided with the Court, and became the facile instrument of the Crown in repressing both  the  religious  and  civil  liberties  of  the  people.  Gradually  the struggle  between  the  party  called  Puritan  and  the  repressive  Court party became more intense and more bitter during the whole period of the reigns of James I. and Charles I. A new element of conflict was introduced  in  the  fact that the despotic  Court  party  naturally abandoned the Calvinism of the founders of the Church, and adopted that Arminianism which has always prevailed among the parasites of arbitrary  power  and  the  votaries  of  a  churchly  and  sacramental religion.</p>
<p>The denial of all reform, and the unrelenting execution of the "Act of Uniformity," repressing all dissent while robbing the people of every trace of religious liberty, necessarily led to such an extension of the royal prerogative, and such constant resort to arbitrary measures and acts  of  violence,  that  the  civil  liberties  of  the  subject  were  equally trampled  under  foot.  At  last,  after  having  for  an  interval  of  eleven years attempted to govern the nation through the Star Chamber and Court  of  High  Commission,  and  having  prorogued  the  refractory Parliament which met in the spring of that year, the king was forced to  appeal  again  to  the  country,  which  sent  up  in  Nov,  1640,  that illustrious body subsequently known as the Long Parliament. In the</p>
<p>May of the next year this body rendered itself practically independent of the king's caprice by passing an act, providing that it should be dissolved only at its own consent, and at the same time all the members of both houses, except two of the peers, subscribed a bond binding them to persevere in the defence of their liberties and of the Protestant religion. In the same year Parliament abolished the Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber; and in Nov, 1642, it  was ordained that after Nov 5, 1643, the office of archbishop and bishop, and the whole framework of prelate government, should be abolished.</p>
<p>In Jun 12, 1643, the Parliament passed an act entitled "An ordinance of  the  Lords  and  Commons  in  Parliament,  for  the  calling  of  an Assembly  of  Divines  and  others,  to  be  consulted  with  by  the Parliament  for  the  settling  of  the  government  and  liturgy  of  the Church of England, and clearing of the Doctrine of said Church from false aspersions and interpretations." As the preexisting government of the Church by bishops had ceased to exist, and yet the Church of Christ in England remained, the only universally recognized authority which could convene the representatives of the Church in General  Assembly  was  the  National  Legislature.  The  persons  who were to constitute this Assembly were named in the ordinance, and comprised the flower of the Church of that age; subsequently about twenty-one clergymen were superadded to make up for the absence of  others.  The  original  list  embraced  the  names  of  ten  lords  and twenty  commoners  as  lay-members,  and  one  hundred  and  twentyone divines. Men of all shades of opinion as to Church government were embraced in this illustrious company-Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Independents and Erastians. "In the original ordinance four bishops were named, one of whom actually attended on the first day, and another excused his absence on the ground of necessary duty; of the others called, five became bishops afterward, and about twenty-five declined attending, partly because it was not a regular  convocation  called  by  the  king,  and  partly  because  the Solemn  League  and  Covenant  was  expressly  condemned  by  his majesty."[3] The Scotch General Assembly also sent as delegates to</p>
<p>Westminster the best and ablest men she had-ministers Alexander Henderson,  the  author  of  the  Covenant,  George  Gillespie,  Samuel Rutherford and Robert Baillie; and elders Lord John Maitland and Sir Archibald Johnston.</p>
<p>Only sixty appeared the first day, and the average attendance during the  protracted  sittings  of  the  Assembly  ranged  between  sixty  and eighty.  Of  these  the  vast  majority  were  Presbyterians,  after  the Episcopalians  had  withdrawn  subsequently  to  the  signing  of  the Solemn  League  and  Covenant.  The  vast  majority  of  the  Puritan clergy, after the  example  of  all  the  Reformed  churches  of  the Continent,  were  inclined  to  Presbyterianism,  and  in  many  places, especially in the city of London and its neighbourhood, had erected presbyteries.</p>
<p>There  were  only  five  prominent  Independents  in  the  Assembly, headed by Dr. Thomas Goodwin and Pastor Philip Nye. These were called,  from  the  attitude  of  opposition  to  the  majority  which  they occupied, "The Five Dissenting Brethren." In spite of the smallness of their  number,  they  possessed  considerable  influence  in  hindering, and finally preventing, the Assembly in its work of national ecclesiastical construction, and  their influence was  due  to  the support they received from politicians without the Assembly, in the Long  Parliament,  in  the  army,  and,  above  all,  from  the  great Cromwell himself.</p>
<p>The Erastians, who held that Christian pastors are simply teachers and not rulers in the Church, and that all ecclesiastical as well as all civil power rests exclusively with the civil magistrate, were represented in the Assembly by only two ministers-Thomas Coleman and John Lightfoot, assisted actively by the learned layman, John Selden. Their influence was due to the fact that the Parliament sympathized  with  them,  and  as  a  matter  of  course  all  worldly politicians.</p>
<p>The prolocutor, or moderator, appointed by the Parliament, was Dr. Twisse, and after his death he was succeeded by Mr. Herle. On Jul 1, 1643, the Assembly, after hearing a sermon from the prolocutor in the  Abbey Church, Westminster, was organized in Henry the VII.'s Chapel.  After  the  weather  grew  cold  they  met  in  the  Jerusalem Chamber,  "a  fair  room  in  the  Abbey  of  Westminster."  When  the whole Assembly had been divided for despatch of business into three equal committees, they took up the work which was first assigned to them  by  Parliament-namely,  the  revision of the "'Thirty-nine Articles,"  the  already  existing  Creed  of  the  English  Church.  But  on Oct  12,  1643  shortly  after  subscribing  the  Solemn  League  and Covenant,  Parliament  directed  the  Assembly  "to  consider  among themselves  of  such  a  discipline  and  government  as  may  be  most agreeable to God's holy word." They consequently entered immediately upon the work of preparing a Directory of Government, Worship  and  Discipline.  Being  delayed  by  constant  controversies with the Independent and Erastian factions, they did not complete this department of their work until near the close of 1644. Then they began to prepare for the composition of a Confession of Faith, and a committee was appointed to prepare and arrange the main propositions to be embraced in it. This committee consisted of Pastor Drs. Gouge,  Temple  and  Hoyle;  Messrs.  Gataker,  Arrowsmith, Burroughs, Burgess, Vines and Goodwin, with the Scotch Commissioners.</p>
<p>The  committee  at  first  wrought  at  the  work  of  preparing  the Confession  and  Catechisms  simultaneously.  "After  some  progress had  been  made  with  both,  the  Assembly  resolved  to  finish  the Confession first, and then to construct the Catechism on its model." They presented in a body the finished Confession to Parliament, Dec 3, 1646, when it was recommitted, that the "Assembly should attach their  marginal  notes,  to  prove  every  part  of  it  by  Scripture."  They finally  reported  it  as  finished,  with  full  Scripture  proofs  of  each separate proposition attached, Apr 29, 1647.</p>
<p>The Shorter Catechism was finished and reported to Parliament Nov 5, 1647, and the Larger Catechism Apr 14, 1648. On Mar 22, 1648, a conference  was  held  between  the  two  Houses,  to  compare  their opinions  respecting  the  Confession  of  Faith,  the  result  of  which  is thus stated by Rushworth:</p>
<p>"The Commons this day (Mar 22, 1648), at a conference, presented the  Lords  with  a  Confession  of  Faith  passed  by  them,  with  some alterations (especially concerning questions of discipline), viz.: That they do agree with their Lordships, and so with the Assembly, in the doctrinal  part,  and  desire  the  same  may  be  made  public,  that  this kingdom, and all  the  Reformed  churches  of  Christendom,  may  see the Parliament of England differ not in doctrine."[4]</p>
<p>The Confession of Faith, Directory of Public Worship and the Larger and  Shorter  Catechisms  were  all  ratified  by  the  Scotch  General Assembly as soon as the several parts of the work were concluded at Westminster.</p>
<p>On Oct 13, 1647, the Long Parliament established the Presbyterian Church in England experimentally, "until the end of the next session of Parliament, which was to be a year after that date." But before that date  the  Parliament  had  become  subservient  to  the  power  of  the army under Cromwell. Presbyteries and synods were soon superseded  by  his  Committee  of  Triers,  while  the  Presbyterian ministers were ejected in mass by Charles II. in 1662.</p>
<p>After  the  completion  of  the  Catechisms,  many  of  the  members quietly dispersed and returned to their homes. "Those that remained in London were chiefly engaged in the examination of such ministers as  presented  themselves  for  ordination  or  induction  into  vacant charges. They continued to maintain their formal existence until Feb 22, 1649, about three weeks after the king's decapitation, having sat five years, six months and twenty-two days, in which time they had held one thousand one hundred and sixty-three sessions. They were then changed into a committee for conducting the trial and examination  of  ministers,  and  continued  to  hold  meetings  for  this purpose, every Thursday morning, until Mar 25, 1652, when, Oliver Cromwell  having  forcibly  dissolved  the  Long  Parliament  by  whose authority  the Assembly  had  been  at  first  called  together,  that committee also broke up, and separated without any formal dissolution, and as a matter of necessity."</p>
<p>The Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechisms of the Westminster Assembly were adopted by the original Synod in North America, AD 1729, as the "Confession of Faith of this Church," and it has been received as the standard of faith by all the branches of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, England, Ireland and America; and it  is  highly  reverenced, and its Catechisms used as means of public instruction, by all the Congregational bodies of Puritan stock in the world.[5]</p>
<p>Although the Westminster Assembly resolutely excluded from their Confession  all  that  they  recognized  as  savouring  of  Erastian  error, yet their opinions as to church establishments led to views concerning  the  powers  of  civil  magistrates,  concerning  religious things (circa sacra), which have always been rejected in this country. Hence, in the original "Adopting Act," the Synod declared that it did not receive the passages relating to this point in the Confession "in any such sense as to suppose the civil magistrate hath a controlling power over  synods  with  respect  to  the  exercise  of  their  ministerial authority;  or  power  to  persecute  any  for  their  religion,  or  in  any sense  contrary  to  the  Protestant  succession  to  the  throne  of  Great Britain."</p>
<p>And again, when the Synod revised and amended its standards in AD 1787, in preparation for the organization of the General Assembly in AD  1789,  it  "took  into  consideration  the  last  paragraph  of  the twentieth  chapter  of  the  Westminster  Confession  of  Faith;  [WCF 20.4]  the  third  paragraph  of  the  twenty-third  chapter,  [WCF  23.3] and the first  paragraph  of  the  thirty-first  chapter;  [WCF  31.1]  and, having  made  some  alterations,  agreed  that  the  said  paragraphs  as now  altered  be  printed  for  consideration."  As  thus  altered  and amended, this Confession and these Catechisms were adopted as the doctrinal  part  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  in America in AD 1788, and so stand to this day.</p>
<p>The  original  Articles  of  the  Westminster  Confession  as  to  the  civil magistrate which are altered in our Confession are as follow:</p>
<p>WCF 20.4, of certain  offenders  it  is  said:  "They  may  be  proceeded against by the censures of the Church and by the power of the civil magistrate."  WCF  23.3:  "The  civil  magistrate  may  not  assume  to himself  the  administration  of  the  Word  and  sacraments,  or  the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven; yet he hath authority, and it is his duty, to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the  Church; that the truth of God be kept pure and entire; that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevented or reformed, and all ordinances of  God  duly  settled,  administered  and  observed.  For  the  better effecting  whereof,  he  hath  power  to  call  synods,  to  be  present  at them,  and  to  provide  that  whatsoever  is  transacted  in  them  be according  to  the  mind  of  God."  WCF  31.2:  "As  magistrates  may lawfully call a synod of ministers and other fit persons to consult and advise  with  about  matters  of  religion,  so,  if  magistrates  be  open enemies  to  the  Church,  the  ministers  of  Christ  of  themselves,  by virtue of their office, or they with other fit persons upon delegation from their churches, may meet together in such assemblies."</p>

<p>SECTION  I.  --Although  the  light  of  nature;  and  the  works  of creation; and providence; do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and  power  of  God,  as  to  leave  men  unexcusable;  yet  are  they  not sufficient  to  give  that  knowledge  of  God  and  of  His  will,  which  is necessary  unto  salvation.  Therefore  it  pleased  the  Lord,  at  sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal; Himself, and to declare; that His will unto His Church; and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth,  and  for  the  more  sure  establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the  malice  of  Satan  and  of  the  world,  to  commit  the  same  wholly unto writing: which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now ceased.</p>

<p>This section affirms the following propositions: -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the light of nature and the works of creation and providence are  sufficient  to  make  known  the  fact  that  there  is  a  God,  and somewhat of his nature and character, so as to leave the disobedience of men without excuse.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  nevertheless  the  amount  and  kind  of  knowledge  thus attainable is not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  consequently  it  has  pleased  God,  of  his  sovereign  grace,  to make,  in various ways  and  at different times, a supernatural</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the human family.  4.  And  that  subsequently  God  has  been  pleased  to commit  that  revelation  to  writing,  and  that  it  is  now  exclusively embraced in the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The light of nature and the works of creation and providence are sufficient to enable men to ascertain the fact that there is a God, and somewhat  of  his  nature  and  character,  end  thus  render  them inexcusable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Three generically distinct false opinions have been entertained with respect  to  the  capacity  of  men,  in  their  present  circumstances,  to attain to any positive knowledge of the being and character of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  There  is  the  assumption  of  all  those  extreme  Rationalists  who deny the existence of any world beyond the natural one discoverable by  our  senses,  and  especially  of  that  school  of  Positive  Philosophy inaugurated by Auguste Comte in France, and represented by John Stuart  Mill  and  Herbert  Spencer  in  England,  who  affirm  that  all possible human knowledge is confined to the facts of our experience and the uniform laws which regulate the succession of those facts; that it is not possible for the human mind, in its present state, to go beyond the simple order of nature to the knowledge of an absolute First  Cause,  or  to  a  designing  and  disposing  Supreme  Intelligence, even though such an one actually exists; that whether there be a God. or not, yet as a matter of fact he is not revealed, and as a matter of principle  could  not,  even  if  revealed,  be  recognized  by  man  in  the present state of his faculties.</li>
</ul>
<p>This  assumption  is  disproved  -  (a.)  By  the  fact  that  men  of  all nations, ages, and degrees of culture, have discerned the evidences of the presence of a God in the works of nature and providence, and in the inward workings of their own souls. This has been true, not only of individuals, communities, or generations unenlightened by science,  but  pre-eminently  of  some  of  the  very  first  teachers  of positive  science  in  the  modern  scientific  age,  such  as  Sir  Isaac</p>
<p>Newton, Sir David Brewster, Dr. Faraday, etc. (b.) By the fact that the works  of  nature  and  providence  are  full  of  the  manifest  traces  of design, and that they can be scientifically explained, and as a matter of  fact  are  explained  by  these  very  sceptics  themselves, only by the recognition and accurate tracing out of the evident " intention" which each of these works is adapted to subserve in their mutual relations. (c.) The same is disproved from the fact that conscience, which is a universal  and  indestructible  element  of  human  nature,  necessarily implies  our  accountability  to  a  personal  moral  Governor,  and  as  a matter of fact has uniformly led men to a recognition of his existence and of their relation to him.</p>
<p>(2.)  An  extreme  opinion  on  this  subject  has  been  held  by  some Christians, to the effect that no true and certain knowledge of God can be derived. by man, in his present condition, from the light of nature in the entire absence of a supernatural revelation; that we are altogether dependent upon such a revelation for any certain knowledge that God exists, as well as for all knowledge of his nature and his purposes.</p>
<p>This opinion is disproved -- (a.) By the direct testimony of Scripture. Rom.  i.  20  --  24;  ii.  14,  15.  (b.)  By  the  fact  that  many  conclusive arguments for the existence of a great First Cause, who is at the same time  an  intelligent  personal  Spirit  and  righteous  moral  Governor, have been drawn by a strict induction from the facts of nature alone, as  they  lie  open  to  the  natural  understanding.  The  fact  that  this argument  remains  unanswerable  shows  that  the  process  by  which the conclusions are drawn from purely natural sources is legitimate. (c.)  All  nations, however destitute of a supernatural revelation they may have been, have yet possessed some knowledge of a God. And in the case of the most enlightened of the heathen, natural religion has given  birth  to  a  considerable  natural  theology.  We  must,  however, distinguish  between  that  knowledge  of  the  divine  character  which may be obtained by men from the worlds of nature arid providence in the exercise of their natural powers alone, without any suggestions or assistance derived from a supernatural revelation --as is illustrated  in  the  theological  writings  of  some  most  eminent  of  the heathen who lived before Christ -- and that knowledge which men in this  age,  under  the  clear  light  of  a  supernatural  revelation,  are competent to deduce from a study of nature. The natural theology of the modern Rationalists demonstrably owes all its special excellences to that Christian revelation it is intended to supersede.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3.) The third erroneous opinion which has been entertained on this subject is that of Deists and theistic Rationalists -- viz., that the light of  nature,  when  legitimately  used,  is  perfectly  sufficient  of  itself  to lead  men  to  all  necessary  knowledge  of  God's  being,  nature,  and purposes. Some German Rationalists, while admitting that a supernatural revelation  has  been  given  in  the  Christian  Scriptures, yet  insist  that  its  only  office  is  to  illustrate  and  enforce  the  truths already  given  through  the  light  of  nature,  which  are  sufficient  in themselves, and need re-enforcement only because they are ordinarily  not  properly  attended  to  by  men.  But,  in  opposition  to this, the Confession teaches --</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the amount of knowledge attainable by the light of nature is not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is proved to be true -- (1.) From Scripture. 1 Cor. i. 21; ii. 13, 14. (2.)  From  the  fact  that  man's  moral  relations  to  God  have  been disturbed by sin; and while the natural light of reason may teach an unfallen  being  spontaneously  how  he  should  approach  and  serve God, and while it may teach a fallen being what the nature of God may demand as to the punishment of sin, it can teach nothing by way of anticipation as to what God may be sovereignly disposed to do in the  way  of  remission,  substitution,  sanctification,  restoration,  etc. (3.)  'From  the  facts  presented  in  the  past  history  of  all  nations destitute of the light of revelation, both before and since Christ. The truths they have  held  have  been  incomplete  and.  mixed  with fundamental  error;  their  faith  has  been  uncertain;  their  religious rites have  been  degrading,  and  their lives immoral.  The  only apparent  exception  to  this  fact is found  in  the case of some Rationalist'  in  Christian  lands;  and  their  exceptional  superiority  to others of their creed is due to the secondary influences of that system of  supernatural  religion  which  they  deny,  but  the  power  of  which they cannot exclude.</p>
<p>Hence, the Confession teaches in this section --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  consequently  it  has  pleased  God,  of  his  sovereign  grace,  to make,  in  various  ways  and  at  different  times,  a  super  natural revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the human family. And that --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God has been pleased subsequently to commit that revelation to writing, and it is now exclusively embraced in the Sacred Scriptures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since,  as  above  shown,  the  light  of  nature  is  insufficient  to  enable men to attain such a knowledge of God and his will as is necessary for  salvation,  it  follows  --  (1.)  That  a  supernatural  revelation  is absolutely necessary for man; and, (2.) From what natural religion alone teaches us of the character of God, it follows that the giving of such a revelation is in the highest degree antecedently probable on his  part.  Man  is  essentially  a  moral  agent,  and  needs  a  clearly revealed rule of duty; and a religious being, craving communion with God. In his natural state these are both unsatisfied. But God is the author of human nature. His intelligence leads us to believe that he will complete all his works and crown a religious nature with the gift of  a  religion  practically  adequate  to  its  wants.  The  benevolence  of God  leads  us  to  anticipate  that  he  will  not  leave  his  creatures  in bewilderment and ruin for the want of light as to their condition and duties. And his righteousness occasions the presumption that he will at some  time  speak  in  definite  and  authoritative  tones  to  the conscience  of  his  subjects.  (3.)  As  a  matter  of  fact,  God  has  given such a revelation. Indeed he has in no period of human history left himself without a witness. His communications to mankind through the first three thousand years were made in very " diverse manners"- by theophanies and audible voices, dreams, visions, the Urim and Thummim,  and  prophetic  inspiration;  and  the  results  of  these communications were diffused and perpetuated by means of tradition.</p>
<p>The fact that such a revelation has been made, and. that we ' have it in  the  Christian  Scriptures,  is  fully  substantiated  by  that  mass  of proof styled the " Evidences of Christianity." The main departments of this evidence are the following: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(a.) The Old and New Testaments, whether the Word of God or not, bear all the marks of genuine and authentic historical records.</li>
<li>(b.) The miracles recorded in these Scriptures are established as facts by abundant testimony; and when admitted as facts they demonstrate the religion they accompany to be from God.</li>
<li>(c.) The same is true in all respects with regard to the many explicit prophecies already fulfilled which are contained in the Scriptures.</li>
<li>(d.) The unparalleled perfection of the moral system they teach, and the  supernatural  intelligence  they  discover  in  adaptation  to  all human characters and conditions in all ages.</li>
<li>(e.) The absolutely perfect excellence of its Founder.</li>
<li>(f.)  The  spiritual  power  of  Christianity,  as  shown  in  the  religious experience  of  individuals,  and  also  in  the  wider  influence  it  exerts over communities and nations in successive generations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the questions concerning the Holy Scriptures as containing the whole of this revelation now made by God to men, see below.</p>
<p>SECTION II. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written,  are  now  contained  all  the  books  of  the  Old  and  New Testament, which are these:</p>
<h2 id="of-the-old-testament">Of the Old Testament:<a class="headerlink" href="#of-the-old-testament" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,  I  Samuel,  II  Samuel,  I  Kings,  II  Kings,  I  Chronicles,  II Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,  The  Song  of  Songs,  Isaiah,  Jeremiah,  Lamentations,</p>
<p>Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.</p>
<p>Of the New Testament:</p>
<p>The Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians I, Corinthians II, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians I , Thessalonians II , To Timothy I , To Timothy II, To Titus,  To  Philemon,  The  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews,  The  Epistle  of James, The first and second Epistles of Peter, The first, second, and third Epistles of John, The Epistle of Jude, The Revelation of John.</p>
<p>All which are given by inspiration of God to be the rule of faith and life.</p>
<p>SECTION III. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine  inspiration,  are  no  part  of  the  canon  of  the  Scripture,  and therefore  are  of  no  authority  in  the  Church  of  God,  nor  to  be  any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.</p>
<h2 id="scripture-proof-texts_1">Scripture Proof Texts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripture-proof-texts_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Luke xvi. 29, 31; Eph. ii. 20; Rev. xxii. 18, 19; 2 Tim. iii. 16. Luke xxiv. 27, 44; Rom. iii. 2; 2 Peter i. 21.</p>
<p>These sections affirm the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  complete  canon  of  Scripture  embraces  in  the  two  great divisions of the Old and the New Testaments all the particular books here named.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the books commonly called Apocrypha form no part of that canon, and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other human writings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That all the canonical books were divinely inspired, and are thus given to us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  complete  canon  of  Scripture  embraces  in  the  two  great divisions  of  the  Old  and  New  Testaments  all  the  particular  books here named.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Old Testament is the collection of inspired writings given by God to his Church during the Old Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace; and the New Testament is the collection of those inspired writings which  he  gave  during  the  New  or  Christian  Dispensation  of  that Covenant.</p>
<p>We determine what books have a place in this canon or divine rule by an  examination  of  the  evidences  which  show  that  each  of  them, severally,  was  written  by  the  inspired.  prophet  or  apostle  whose name it bears; or, as in the case of the Gospels of Mark and Luke, written under the superintendence and published by the authority of an apostle. This evidence in the case of the Sacred Scriptures is of the same  kind  of  historical  and  critical  proof  as  is  relied  upon  by  all literary  men  to  establish  the  genuineness  and  authenticity  of  any other ancient writings, such as the Odes of Horace or the works of Herodotus. In general this evidence is (a) Internal, such as language, style, and the character of the matter they contain; (b) External, such as the testimony of contemporaneous writers, the universal consent of  contemporary  readers,  and  corroborating  history  drawn  from independent credible sources.</p>
<p>The genuineness of the books constituting the Old Testament canon as now received by all Protestants is established as follows: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  Christ  and  his  apostles  endorse  as  genuine  and  authentic  the canon of Jewish Scriptures as it existed in their time. (a) Christ often quotes  as  the  Word  of  God  the  separate  books  and  the  several divisions  embraced  in  the  Jewish  Scriptures  --  viz.,  the  Law,  the Prophets, and. the Holy Writings or Psalms. Mark xiv. 49; Luke xxiv. 44; John v. 39. (b) The apostles also quote them as the Word of God; 2  Tim.  iii.  15,  16;  Acts  i.  16.  (c)  Christ  often  rebuked  the  Jews  for</li>
</ul>
<p>disobeying, but never for forging or corrupting their Scriptures, Matt xxii. 29.</p>
<p>(2.) The Jewish canon thus endorsed by Christ and his apostles is the same as that we now have. (a) The New Testament writers quote as Scripture almost every one of the books we recognize, and no others. (b)  The  Septuagint,  or  Greek  translation  of  the  Hebrew  Scriptures, made in Egypt B.C. 285, which was itself frequently quoted by Christ and his apostles, embraced every book contained in our copies. (c) Josephus, born A.D. 37, enumerates as Hebrew Scriptures the same books  by  their  classes.  (d)  The  testimony  of  the  early  Christian writers  uniformly  agrees  with  that  of  the  ancient  Jews  as  to  every book.  (e)  Ever  since  the  time  of  Christ  both  Jews  and  Christians, while rival and hostile parties, have separately kept the same canon, and agree perfectly as to the genuineness and authenticity of every book.</p>
<p>The evidence which establishes the canonical authority of the several books of the New Testament may be generally stated as follows: (a) The early Christian writers in all parts of the world agree in quoting as of apostolical authority the books we receive, while they quote all other  contemporaneous writings only for illustration. (b) The early Church Fathers furnish a number of catalogues of the books received by them as apostolical, all of which agree perfectly as to most of the books, and differ only in a slight degree with reference to some last written or least generally circulated. (c)  The  earliest  translations  of the Scriptures prove that, at the time they were made, the books they contain  were  recognized  as  Scripture.  The  Peshito,  or  early  Syriac translation, agrees  almost  entirely  with  ours;  and  the  Vulgate, prepared by Jerome A.D. 385, was based on the Italic or early Latin version,  and  agrees  entirely  with  ours.  (d)  The  internal  evidence corroborates the external testimony in the case of all the books. This consists  of  the  language  and  idiom  in  which  they  are  written;  the harmony in all essentials in the midst of great variety in form and circumstantials; the elevated spirituality and doctrinal consistency of all  the  books;  and  their  practical  power  over  the  consciences  and hearts of men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>But the books called Apocrypha form no part of the sacred canon, and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other human writings.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The word Apocrypha (anything hidden) has been applied to certain ancient  writings  whose  authorship  is  not  manifest,  and  for  which unfounded claims have been set up for a place in the canon. Some of these  have  been  associated  with  the  Old  and.  some  with  the  New Testament. In this section of the Confession, however, the name is applied. principally to those spurious scriptures for which a place is claimed  in  the  Old  Testament  canon  by  the  Roman  Church.  These are Tobit, Wisdom, Judith, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, and the two books of Maccabees. They also prefix to the book of Daniel the History of Susannah,  and  insert  in  the  third  chapter  the  Song  of  the  Three Children; and add to the end of the book the History of Bel and the Dragon.</p>
<p>That these books have no right to a place in the canon is proved by the  following  facts:  (1.)  They  never  formed  a  part  of  the  Hebrew Scriptures.  They  have  always  been  rejected  by  the  Jews,  to  whose guardianship  the  Old  Testament  Scriptures  were  committed.  (2.) None of them were ever quoted by Christ or the apostles. (3.) They were never embraced in the list of the canonical books by the early Fathers;  and  even  in  the  Roman  Church  their  authority  was  not accepted by the most learned and candid men until after it was made an  article  of  faith  by  the  Council  of  Trent,  late  in  the  sixteenth century.  (4.)  The  internal  evidence  presented  by  their  contents disproves their claims. None of them make any claim to inspiration, while the best of them disclaim it. Some of them consist of childish fables, and inculcate bad morals.</p>
<h2 id="and-this-section-teaches-">And this section teaches --<a class="headerlink" href="#and-this-section-teaches-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  all  the  canonical  Scriptures  were  divinely  inspired,  and  are</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>thus given us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.</p>
<p>The books of Scripture were written by the instrumentality of men, and  the  national  and  personal  peculiarities  of  their  authors  have been evidently as freely expressed in their writing, and their natural faculties, intellectual and moral, as freely exercised in their production, as those of the authors of any other writings. Nevertheless  these  books  are,  one  and  all,  in  thought  and  verbal expression, in substance  and  form,  wholly the Word  of  God, conveying with absolute accuracy and divine authority all that  God meant them to convey, without any human additions or admixtures. This  was  accomplished  by  a  supernatural  influence  of  the  Spirit  of God acting upon the spirits of the sacred writers, called "inspiration;" which accompanied them uniformly in what they wrote; and which, without  violating  the  free  operation  of  their  faculties,  yet  directed them in all they wrote, and secured the infallible expression of it in words. The nature of this divine influence we, of course, can no more understand  than  we  can  in  the  case  of  any  other  miracle.  But  the effects are plain and certain -- viz., that all written under it is the very Word  of  God,  of  infallible  truth,  and  of  divine  authority;  and  this infallibility  and  authority  attach  as  well  to  the  verbal  expression  in which the revelation is conveyed as to the matter of the revelation itself.</p>
<p>The fact that the Scriptures are thus inspired is proved because they assert it of themselves; and because they must either be credited as true in this respect, or rejected as false in all respects; 'and because God authenticated the claims of their writers by accompanying their teaching  with  "signs  and  wonders  and  divers  miracles."  Heb.  ii.  4. Wherever God sends his "sign," there he commands belief; but it is impossible that he could unconditionally command belief except to truth infallibly conveyed.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) The Old Testament writers claimed to be inspired. Deut. xxxi. 19 -- 22; xxxiv. 10; Num. xvi. 28, 29; 2 Sam. xxiii. 2. As a characteristic fact, they speak in the name of God, prefacing their messages with a</li>
</ul>
<p>"Thus  saith  the  LORD.  "The  mouth  of  the  LORD  hath  spoken  it." Deut. xviii. 21, 22; 1 Kings xxi. 19; Jer. ix. 12, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) The New Testament writers introduce their quotations from the Old Testament with such formulas as, "The Holy Ghost saith," Heb. iii. 7; "The Holy Ghost this signifying," Heb. ix. 8; "Saith God," Acts ii.  17;  1  Cor.  ix.  9,  10;  "The Lord by the mouth of his servant David saith," Acts iv. 25; "The Lord limiteth in David a certain day, saying," Heb. iv. 7.</li>
<li>(3.) The inspiration of the Old Testament is expressly affirmed in the New Testament. Luke i. 70; Heb. i. 1; 2 Tim. iii. 16; 1 Pet. i. 10 -- 12; 2 Pet. i. 21.</li>
<li>(4.)  Christ  and  his  apostles  constantly  quote  the  Old  Testament  as infallible,  as  that  which  must  be  fulfilled.  Matt.  v.  18;  John  x.  35; Luke xxiv. 44; Matt. ii. 15 -- 23, etc.</li>
<li>(5.) Inspiration was promised to the apostles. Matt. x. 19; xxviii. 19, 20; Luke xii. 12; John xiii. 20; xiv. 26; xv. 26, 27; xvi. 13.</li>
<li>(6.) They claimed to have the Spirit, in fulfillment of the promise of Christ, Acts ii. 33; xv. 28; 1 Thess. i. 5; -- to speak as the prophets of God, 1 Cor. iv. 1; 1 Thess. iv. 8; -- to speak with plenary authority, 1 Cor. ii. 13; 2 Cor. xiii. 2-4; Gal. i. 8, 9. They put their writings on a level with the Old Testament Scriptures. 2 Pet. iii. 16; 1 Thess. v. 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION IV. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.[9]</p>
<p>SECTION V. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church  to  an  high  and  reverent  esteem  of  the  Holy  Scripture.[10] And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty  of  the  style,  the  consent  of  all  the  parts,  the  scope  of  the whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of  the  only  way  of  man's  salvation,  the  many  other  incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth  and  divine  authority  thereof,  is  from  the  inward  work  of  the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.[11]</p>
<h2 id="scripture-proof-texts_2">Scripture Proof Texts<a class="headerlink" href="#scripture-proof-texts_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>[9] 2 Peter i. 19, 21; 2 Tim. iii. 16; 1 John v. 9; 1 Thess. ii. 13. [10] 1 Tim. iii. 15; [11] 1 John ii. 20, 27; John xvi. 13, 14; 1 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 12; Isa. lix. 21.</p>
<p>This section teaches the following propositions: --</p>
<ol>
<li>That the authority of the inspired Scriptures does not rest upon the testimony of the Church, but directly upon God.</li>
</ol>
<p>This  proposition  is  designed  to  deny  the  Romish  heresy  that  the inspired Church is the ultimate source of all divine know ledge, and that  the  written  Scripture  and  ecclesiastical  tradition  alike  depend upon the authoritative seal of the Church for their credibility. They thus make the Scriptures a product of the Spirit through the Church; while,  in  fact,  the  Church  is  a  product  of  the  Spirit  through  the instrumentality of the Word. It is true that the testimony of the early Church  to  the  apostolic  authorship  of  the  several  books  is  of fundamental importance, just as a subject may bear witness to the identity of an heir to the crown; but the authority of the Scriptures is no  more  derived  from  the  Church  than  that  of  the  king  from  the subject who proves the fact that he is the legal heir.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  internal  evidences  of  a  divine  origin  contained  in  and inseparable from the Scriptures themselves are conclusive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a part of the evidences of Christianity considered under sect. i. The internal marks of a divine origin in the Bible are such as -- (1.) The phenomena it presents of a supernatural intelligence: in unity of design developed through its entire structure, although it is composed  of  sixty-six  separate  books,  by  forty  different  authors, writing at intervals through sixteen centuries; in its perfect freedom from all the errors incident to the ages of its production, with regard to facts or opinions of whatever kind; in. the marvellous knowledge it exhibits of human nature under all possible relations and conditions; in  the  original  and  luminous  solution  it  affords  of  many  of  the darkest problems of human history and destiny. (2.) The unparalleled  perfection  of  its  moral  system:  in  the  exalted  view  it gives  of  God,  his  law,  and  moral  government;  in  its  exalted  yet practical and beneficent system of morality, set forth and effectively enforced; in its wondrous power over the human conscience; and in the unrivalled extent and persistence of its influence over communities of men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Yet  that  the  highest  and  most  influential  faith  in  the  truth  and authority of the Scriptures is the direct work of the Holy Spirit on our hearts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Scriptures to the unregenerate man are like light to the blind. They may be felt as the rays of the sun are felt by the blind, but they cannot  be  fully  seen.  The  Holy  Spirit  opens  the  blinded  eyes  and gives due sensibility to the diseased heart; and thus assurance comes with the evidence of spiritual experience. When first regenerated, he begins to set the Scriptures to the test of experience; and the more he advances, the more he proves them true, and the more he discovers of  their  limitless  breadth  and  fulness,  and  their  evidently  designed adaptation to all human wants under all possible conditions.</p>
<p>SECTION  VI.  The  whole  counsel  of  God  concerning  all  things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions  of  men.[12]  Nevertheless,  we  acknowledge  the  inward illumination  of  the  Spirit  of  God  to  be  necessary  for  the  saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word:[13] and that  there  are  some  circumstances  concerning  the  worship  of  God, and  government  of  the  Church,  common  to  human  actions  and societies,  which  are  to  be  ordered  by  the  light  of  nature,  and Christian  prudence,  according  to  the  general  rules  of  the  Word, which are always to be observed.[14]</p>
<p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
<p>[12] 2 Tim. iii. 15 ,16, 17; Gal. i. 8, 9; 2 Thess. ii. [13] 2; John vi. 45; 1 Cor. ii. 9 to 12; [14] 1 Cor. xi. 13, 14; 1 Cor. xiv. 26. 40.</p>
<p>This section teaches the following propositions: --</p>
<ol>
<li>The  inspired  Scriptures  of  the  Old.  And  New  Testaments  are  a complete  rule  of  faith  and  practice:  they  embrace  the  whole  of whatever supernatural revelation God  now  makes  to  men,  and  are abundantly  sufficient  for  all  the  practical  necessities  'of  men  or communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>This  is  proved  --  (1.)  From  the  design  of  Scripture.  It  professes  to lead us to God. Whatever is necessary to that end it must teach us. If any  supplementary  knowledge  is  necessary,  it  must  refer  to  it. Incompleteness in such an undertaking would be falsehood. But (2.) while  Christ  and  his  apostles  constantly  refer  to  Scripture  as  an authoritative  rule,  neither  they  nor  the  Scriptures  themselves  ever refer  to  any  other  source  of  divine  revelation  whatsoever.  They therefore  assume  all  the  awful  prerogatives  of  completeness.  John xx. 31; 2 Tim. iii. 15 -- 17. And (3.), as a matter of fact, the Scriptures do teach a perfect system of doctrine, and all the principles which are necessary  for  the  practical  regulation  of  the  lives  of  individuals, communities, and churches. The more diligent men have been in the study of the Bible, and the more assiduous they have been in carrying out  its  instructions  into  practice,  the  less  has  it  been  possible  for them to believe that it is incomplete in any element of a perfect rule of  all  that  which  man  is  to  believe  concerning  God,  and  of  all  that duty which God requires of man.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nothing  during  the  present  dispensation  is  to  be  added  to  this complete rule of faith, either by new revelations of the Spirit or by traditions of men.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No new revelations of the Spirit are to be expected now --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  Because  he  has  already  given  us  a  complete  and  all-sufficient rule. (2.) because,  while  the  Old.  Testament  foretells  the  new dispensation,  the  New  Testament  does  not  refer  to  any  further revelation  to  be  expected  before  the  second  advent  of  Christ:  they always  refer  to  the  "coming"  or  "appearance"  of  Christ  as  the  very next supernatural event to be anticipated. (3.) As a matter of fact, no pretended revelations of the Spirit since the days of the apostles have borne  the marks  or  been  accompanied  with  the  "signs"  of  a supernatural  revelation:  on  the  contrary,  all  that  have  been  made public --as those of Swedenborg and the Mormons  -are inconsistent  with  Scripture  truth,  directly  oppose  the  authority  of Scripture, and teach bad morals; while private revelations have been professed only by vain enthusiasts, and are incapable of verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditions  of  men  cannot  be  allowed  to  supplement  Scripture  as  a rule of faith, because -- (1.) The Scriptures, while undertaking to lead men to a saving knowledge of God, never once ascribe authority to any  such  a  supplementary  rule.  (2.)  Christ  rebukes  the  practical observance of it in the Pharisees. Matt. xv. 3 -- 6; Mark vii. 7, 8. (3.) Tradition cannot supplement Scripture, because, while the latter is definite, complete, and perspicuous, the former is essentially indeterminate,  obscure,  and  fragmentary.  (4.)  The  only  system  of ecclesiastical  tradition  which  pretends  to  rival  the  Scriptures  as  a rule  of  faith  is  that  of  the  Roman  Church;  and  her  traditions  are, many of them, demonstrably of modern origin. None can be traced to the apostolic age, much  less to an apostolic origin: they are inconsistent  with  the  clear  teaching  of  Scripture,  and  with  the opinions of many of the highest authorities in that Church itself in past ages.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless, a personal spiritual illumination by the power of the Holy Ghost is necessary, in every case, for the practical  and  saving knowledge of the truth embraced in the Scriptures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This necessity does not result from any want of either completeness or clearness in the revelation, but from the fact that man in a state of nature is carnal, and unable to discern the things of the Spirit of God. Spiritual illumination differs from inspiration, therefore, (1.) In that it conveys no new truths to the understanding, but simply opens the mind  and  heart  of  the  subject  to  the  spiritual  discernment  and appreciation of the truth already objectively presented in the Scriptures; and (2.) In that it is an element in regeneration common to all the children of God, and not peculiar to prophets or apostles; and hence, (3.) In that it is private and personal in its use, and not public.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That, while the Scriptures are a complete rule of faith and practice, and  while  nothing  is  to  be  regarded  as  an  article  of  faith  to  be believed, or a religious duty obligatory upon the conscience, which is not explicitly or implicitly taught in Scripture, nevertheless they do not  descend  in  practical  matters  into  details,  but,  laying  down general principles, leave men to apply them in the exercise of their natural  judgment,  in  the  light  of  experience,  and  in  adaptation  to changing  circumstances,  as  they  are  guided  by the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This liberty, of course, is allowed only within the limits of the strict interpretation  of  the  principles  taught  in  the  Word,  and  in  the legitimate application of those principles, and applies to the regulation of the practical life of the individual and of the Church, in detailed adjustments to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>SECTION  VII.  All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves,  nor  alike  clear  unto  all:[15]  yet  those  things  which  are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that  not  only  the  learned,  but  the  unlearned,  in  a  due  use  of  the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them. [16]</p>
<p>Scripture Proof Texts</p>
<p>[15] 2 Pet. iii. 16; [16] Psalm cxix. 105, 130.</p>
<p>This section affirms --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the Scriptures are in such a sense perspicuous that all that is necessary  for  man  to  know,  in  order  to  his  salvation  or  for  his practical guidance in duty, may be learned therefrom; and --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That they are designed for the personal use, and are adapted to the instruction, of the unlearned as well as the learned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Protestants admit that many of the truths revealed in the Scriptures in their own nature transcend human understanding, and that many prophecies  remain  intentionally  obscure  until  explained  by  their fulfillment in the developments of history. Nevertheless, Protestants affirm, and Romnnists deny -- (1.) That every essential article of faith and rule of practice may be clearly learned from Scripture; and (2.) That  private  and  unlearned  Christians  may  be  safely  allowed  to interpret Scripture for themselves. On the other hand, it is true that, with the advance of historical and critical knowledge, and by means of  controversies, the Church as a community has made progress in the accurate interpretation of Scripture and in the full comprehension of the entire system of truth revealed therein.</p>
<p>That the Protestant doctrine on this subject is true, is proved --</p>
<ul>
<li>(a.) From the fact that all Christians promiscuously are commanded to search the Scriptures. 2 Tim.iii.15 -- 17; Acts xvii. 11; John v. 39.</li>
<li>(b.) From the fact that the Scriptures are addressed either to all men or to the whole body of believers. Deut. vi. 4 -- 9; Luke i. 3; Rom. i. 7; 1  Cor.  i.  2;  2  Cor.  i.  1;  and  the  salutations  of  all  the  Epistles  except those to Timothy and Titus.</li>
<li>(c.) The Scriptures are affirmed to be perspicuous. Ps. cxix. 105, 130; 2 Cor. iii. 14; 2 Pet. i. 18, 19; 2 Tim. iii. 15 -- 17.</li>
<li>(d.) The Scriptures address men as a divine law to be obeyed and as a guide to salvation. If for all practical purposes they are not perspicuous they must mislead, and so falsify their pretensions.</li>
<li>(e.)  Experience  has  uniformly  proved  the  truth  of  the  Protestant doctrine.  Those  Churches  which  have  most  faithfully  disseminated the Scriptures in the vernacular among the mass of the people have conformed  most  entirely  to  the  plain  and  certain  sense  of  their teaching  in  faith  and  practice;  while  those  Churches  which  have locked  them  up  in  the  hands  of  a  priesthood  have  to  the  greatest degree departed from them both in letter and spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language  of  the  people  of  God  of  old),  and  the  New  Testament  in Greek  (which,  at  the  time  of  the  writing  of  it,  was  most  generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;[17] so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them.[18] But, because these original tongues are  not  known  to  all  the  people  of  God,  who  have  right  unto,  and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,[19] therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,[20] that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner;[21] and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.[22]</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the Old Testament having been originally written in Hebrew, and  the  New  Testament  in  Greek  --  which  were  the  common languages of the large body of the Church in their respective periods -- the Scriptures in those languages are the absolute rule of faith and ultimate appeal in all controversies.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol>
<li>That  the  original  sacred  text  has  come  down  to  us  in  a  state  of essential purity.</li>

<li>d.  That  the  Scriptures  should  be  translated  into  the  vernacular languages of all people, and copies put into the hands of all capable of reading them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The true text of the ancient Scriptures is ascertained by means of a careful collation and comparison of the following: --</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ancient manuscripts. The oldest existing Hebrew manuscripts date from the ninth or tenth century. The oldest Greek manuscripts date from the fourth to the sixth century. Many hundreds of these have been  collated  by  eminent  scholars  in  forming  the  text  of  modern Hebrew  and  Greek  Testaments.  The  differences  are  found  to  be unimportant, and the essential integrity of our text is established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Quotations from the apostolic Scriptures found in the writings of the  early  Christians.  These  are  so  numerous  that  the  whole  New Testament  might  be  gathered  from  the  worlds  of  writers  dating before the seventh century, and they prove the exact state of the text at the time in which they were made.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Early translations into other languages. The principal of these are the Samaritan Pentateuch, which the Samaritans inherited from the ten  tribes;  the  Greek  Septuagint,  B.C.  285;  the  Peshito  or  ancient</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Syriac version, A.D, 100; the Latin Vulgate of Jerome, A.D. 385; the Coptic of the fifth century, and others of less critical value.</p>
<p>SECTION IX. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture  itself:  and  therefore,  when  there  is  a  question  about  the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it  must  be  searched  and  known  by  other  places  that  speak  more clearly.[23]</p>
<p>SECTION  X.  The  supreme  judge  by  which  all  controversies  of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient  writers,  doctrines  of  men,  and  private  spirits,  are  to  be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.[24]</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  infallible  and  only  true  "rule"  for  the  interpretation  of Scripture is Scripture itself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  Scriptures  are  the  supreme  "judge"  in  all  controversies concerning religion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  authority  of  the  Scriptures  as  the  ultimate  rule  of  faith  rests alone  in  the  fact  that  they  are  the  Word  of  God.  Since  all  these writings  are  one  revelation,  and  the  only  revelation  of  his  will concerning religion given by God to men, it follows: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) That they are complete as a revelation in themselves, and are not to  be  supplemented  or  explained  by  light  drawn  from  any  other source.  (2.)  That  the  different  sections  of  this  revelation  mutually supplement and explain one another. The Holy Spirit who inspired</li>
</ul>
<p>the Scriptures is the only adequate expounder of his own words, and he is promised to all the children of God as a Spirit of light and truth. In dependence upon his guidance, Christians are of course to study the Scriptures, using all the helps of true learning to ascertain their meaning;  but  this  meaning  is  to  be  sought  in  the  light  of  the Scriptures themselves taken as a whole, and not in the light either of tradition or of philosophy.</p>
<p>"A  rule  is  a  standard  of  judgment;  a  judge  is  the  expounder  and applier of that rule to the decision of particular cases."</p>
<p>The  Romish  doctrine  is,  that  the  Papal  Church  is  the  infallible teacher of men in religion; that, consequently, the Church authoritatively  determines,  (1.)  What  is  Scripture;  (2.)  What  is tradition; (3.) What  is  the  true  sense  of  Scripture  and  of  tradition; and (4.) What is the true application of that rule to every particular question of faith or practice.</p>
<p>The Protestant doctrine is,-- (1.) That the Scriptures are the only rule of faith and practice; (2.) (a) Negatively, that there is no body of men qualified  or  authorized  to  interpret  the  Scriptures  or  to apply their teachings to the decision of particular questions in a sense binding upon their fellow - Christians; (3) Positively, that the Scriptures are the only authoritative voice in the Church; which is to be interpreted and  applied  by  every  individual  for  himself,  with  the  assistance, though  not  by  the  authority,  of  his  fellow-Christians.  Creeds  and confessions,  as  to  form,  bind  those  only  who  voluntarily  profess them;  and  as  to  matter,  they  bind  only  so  far  as  they  affirm  truly what the Bible teaches, and because the Bible does so teach.</p>
<p>This  must  be  true  --  (1.)  Because  the  Scriptures,  which  profess  to teach  us  the  way  of  salvation,  refer  us  to  no  standard  or  judge  in matters of religion beyond or above themselves; and because no body of men since the apostles has ever existed, with the qualifications or with the authority to act in the office of judge for their fellows. (2.) Because,  as  we  have  seen,  the  Scriptures  are  themselves  complete and  perspicuous.  (3.)  Because  all  Christians  are  commanded  to search  the  Scriptures,  and  to  judge  both  doctrines  and  professed teachers themselves. John v. 39; 1 John ii. 20, 27; iv. 1, 2; Acts xvii. 11; Gal. i. 8; 1 These. v. 21. (4.) Because all Christians are promised the Holy Spirit to guide them in the understanding and practical use of the truth. Rom. viii. 9; 1 John ii. 20, 27</p>

<p>These sections teach the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There is but one living and true God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This God is a free personal Spirit, without bodily parts or passions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He possesses all absolute perfections in and of himself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He possesses all relative perfections with respect to his creatures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He  is  self-existent  and  absolutely  independent,  the  sole  support, proprietor, and sovereign disposer, of all his creatures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There is but one living and true God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There  have  been  false  gods  innumerable,  and  the  title  "  god"  has been applied to angels (Ps. xcvii. 7), because of their spirituality and exalted  excellence;  and  to  magistrates  (Ps.  1xxxii.  1,  6),  because  of their authority; and Satan is called "the god of this world" (2 Cor. iv. 4), because of his usurped dominion over the wicked. In opposition, therefore,  to  the  claims  of  all  false  gods,  and  in  exclusion  of  all figurative  use  of  the  term,  it  is  affirmed  that  there  is  but  one  true God, one living God.</p>
<p>This affirmation includes two propositions: (a) There is but one God. (b) This one God is an absolute unit, incapable of division.</p>
<p>That there is but one God is proved --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) From the fact that every argument that establishes the being of God,  suggests  the  existence  of  but  one.  There  must  be  one  First Cause, but there is no evidence of more than one. There must be one Designing  Intelligence  and  one  Moral  Governor,  but  neither  the argument from design nor from conscience suggests more than one.</li>
<li>(2.) The  creation throughout its whole extent is one system, presenting absolute unity of design, and hence evidently emanating from one Designing Intelligence.</li>
<li>(3.) The same is true of the system of providential government.</li>
<li>(4.) The sense of moral accountability innate in man witnesses to the unity of the source of all absolute authority.</li>
<li>(5.) All the instincts and cultivated habits of reason lead us to refer the multiplicity of the phenomenal world backward and upward to a ground of absolute unity, which being infinite and absolute, necessarily excludes division and rivalry.</li>
<li>(6.) The Scriptures constantly affirm this truth. Deut. vi. 4; 1 Cor. viii. 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  indivisible unity of this one  God  is  proved  by  the  same arguments.  For  an  essential  division  in  the  one  Godhead  would  in effect constitute two Gods; besides, the Scriptures teach us that the Christian Trinity is one undivided God: "I and my Father are one." John x. 30.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This God is a free personal Spirit, without bodily parts or passions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a very ancient, prevalent, and persistent mode of thought, which  pervades  a  great  deal  of  our  literature  in  the  present  day, which tends to compound God with the world, and to identify him with the laws of nature, the order and beauty of creation. In one way or another he is considered as sustaining to the phenomena of nature the  relation  of  soul  to  body,  or  of  whole  to  parts,  or  of  permanent substance to transient modes. Now all the arguments that establish the being of a God agree with the Scriptures in setting him forth as a personal spirit, distinct from the world.</p>
<p>By Spirit we mean the subject to which the attributes of intelligence, feeling, and will belong, as active properties. Where these unite there is  distinct  personality.  The  argument  from  design  proves  that  the great  First  Cause,  to  whom  the  system  of  the  universe  is  to  be referred, possesses both intelligence, benevolence,  and  will, in selecting ends, and in choosing and adapting means to effect those ends. Therefore he is a personal spirit. The argument from the sense of moral accountability, innate in all men, proves that we are subject to  a  Supreme  Lawgiver,  exterior  and  superior  to  the  person  he governs; one who takes knowledge of us, and will hold us to a strict personal account. Therefore he is a personal spirit, distinct from -though intimately associated with -- the subjects he governs.</p>
<p>We know spirit by self-consciousness, and in affirming that God is a spirit --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  We  affirm  that  he  possesses  in  infinite  perfection  a11  those properties  which  belong  to  our  spirits,  (a)  because  the  Scriptures affirm that we were created in his image; (b) because they attribute all these properties severally to him; (c) because our religious nature demands that we recognize them in him; (d) because their exercise is evidenced in his works of creation and providence; (e) because they were possessed by the divine nature in Christ. And --</li>
<li>(2.) We deny that the properties of matter, such as bodily parts and passions, belong to him. We make this denial --</li>
<li>(a)  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  does  possess  any  such properties; and, (b) because, from the very nature of matter end its</li>
</ul>
<p>affections, it is inconsistent with those infinite and. absolute perfections which are of his essence, such as simplicity, unchangeableness, unity, omnipresence, etc.</p>
<p>When the Scriptures, in condescension to our weakness, express the fact  that  God  hears  by  saying  that  he  has  an  ear,  or  that  he  exerts power by attributing to him a hand, they evidently speak metaphorically,  because  in  the  case  of  men  spiritual  faculties  are exercised  through  bodily  organs.  And  when  they  speak  of  his repenting,  of  his  being  grieved,  or  jealous,  they  use  metaphorical language  also,  teaching  us  that  he  acts  toward  us  as  a  man  would when agitated by such passions. Such metaphors are characteristic rather of the Old than of the New Testament, and occur for the most part  in  highly  rhetorical  passages  of  the  poetical  and  prophetical books.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He possesses all absolute perfections in and of himself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He possesses all relative perfections with respect to his creatures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  attributes  of  God  are  the  properties  of  his  all-perfect  nature. Those are absolute which belong to God considered in himself alone --  as  self-existence,  immensity, eternity, intelligence, etc. Those are relative which characterize him in his relation to his creatures -- as omnipresence, omniscience, etc.</p>
<p>It is evident that we can know only such properties of God as he has condescended to reveal to us, and only so much of these as he has revealed. The question, then, is, What has God revealed to us of his perfections in his Word?</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  God  is  declared  to  be  infinite  in  his  being.  Hence  he  can  exist under none of the limitations of time or space. He must be eternal, and he must fill all immensity. These three, therefore, must be the common perfections of all the properties that belong to his essence: He  is  infinite,  eternal,  omnipresent  in  his  being;  infinite,  eternal, omnipresent in his wisdom, in his power, in his justice,  etc.  When</li>
</ul>
<p>God is said to be infinite in his knowledge, or his power, we mean that  he  knows  all  things,  and  that  he  can  effect  all  that  he  wills, without any limit. When we say that he is infinite in his truth, or his justice, or his goodness, we mean that he possesses these properties in absolute perfection.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.)  His  immensity.  When  we  attribute  this  perfection  to  God  we mean that his essence fills all space. This cannot be effected through multiplication of his essence, since he is ever one and indivisible; nor through its extension or diffusion, like ether, through the interplanetary spaces, because it is pure spirit. The spirit of God, like the spirit of a man, must be an absolute unit, without extension or dimensions. Therefore, the entire  indivisible  Godhead  must,  in  the totality of his being, be simultaneously present every moment of time at every point of space. He is immense absolutely and from eternity. He  has  been  omnipresent,  in  his  essence  and  in  all  the  properties thereof, ever since the creation, to every atom and element of which it  consists.  Although  God  is  essentially  equally  omnipresent  to  all creatures  at  all  times,  yet,  as  he  variously  manifests  himself  at different times and places to his intelligent creatures, so he is said to be peculiarly present to them under such conditions. Thus, God was present  to  Moses  in  the  burning  bush.  Ex.  iii.  2  --  6.  And  Christ promises to be in the midst of two or three met together in his name. Matt. xviii. 20.</li>
<li>(3.) His eternity. By affirming that God is eternal, we mean that his duration has no limit, and that his existence in infinite  duration  is absolutely perfect. He could have had no beginning, he can have no end,  and  in  his  existence  there  can  be  no  succession  of  thoughts, feelings or purposes. There can be no increase to his knowledge, no change as to his purpose. Hence the past and the future must be as immediately  and  as  immutably  present  with  him  as  the  present. Hence his existence is an ever-abiding, all-embracing present, which is always  contemporaneous  with  the  ever-flowing  times  of  his creatures. His knowledge, which never can change, eternally recognizes his creatures and their actions in their several places in</li>
</ul>
<p>time; and his actions upon his creatures pass from him at the precise moments predetermined in his unchanging purpose.</p>
<p>Hence  God  is  absolutely  unchangeable  in  his  being  and  in  all  the modes  and  states thereof. In his knowledge,  his feelings, his purposes, and hence in his engagements to his creatures, he is the same  yesterday,  to-day,  and  for  ever.  "The  counsel  of  the  LORD standeth for  ever,  the  thoughts  of  his  heart  to  all  generations."  Ps. xxxiii. 11.</p>
<p>(4.)  The  infinite  intelligence  of  God,  including  omniscience  and absolutely  perfect  wisdom,  is  clearly  taught  in  Scripture.  God's knowledge is infinite, not only as to the range of objects it embraces, but also as to its perfection. (a) We know things only as they stand related to our organs of perception, and only in their properties; God knows them immediately, in the light of his own intelligence and in their essential nature. (b) We know things successively, as they are present to us, or as we pass inferentially from the know to the before unknown;  God  knows  all  things  eternally, by one direct, allcomprehensive intuition. (c) Our knowledge is dependent; God's is independent. Ours is fragmentary; God's total and complete. Ours is in great measure transient; God's is permanent.</p>
<p>God  knows  himself  --  the  depths  of  his  own  infinite  and  eternal being,  the  constitution  of  his  nature,  the  ideas  of  his  reason  the resources  of  his  power,  the  purposes  of  his  will.  In  knowing  the resources of his power, he knows all things possible. In knowing the immutable purposes of his will, he knows all that has existed or that will exist, because of that purpose.</p>
<p>Wisdom presupposes knowledge, and is that excellent practical use which the absolutely perfect intelligence and will of God make of his infinite knowledge. It is exercised in the election of ends, general and special, and in the selection of means in order to the accomplishment of  those  ends;  and  is  illustrated  gloriously  in  the  perfect  system  of God's works of creation, providence, and grace.</p>
<p>(5.) The omnipotence of God is the infinite efficiency resident in, and inseparable  from,  the  divine  essence,  to  effect  whatsoever  he  wills, without any limitation soever except such as lies in the absolute and immutable perfections of his own nature. The power of God is both unlimited in its range and infinitely perfect in its mode of action. (a) We  are  conscious  that  the  powers  inherent  in  our  wills  are  very limited.  Our  wills  can  act  directly  only  upon  the  course  of  our thoughts  and  a  few  bodily  actions,  and  can  only  very  imperfectly control these. The power inherent in God's will acts directly upon its objects, and effects absolutely and unconditionally all he intends. (b) We work  through  means;  the  effect  often  followers  only  remotely, and  our  action  is  conditioned  by  external  circumstances.  God  acts immediately,  with  or  without  means  as  he  pleases.  When  he  acts through means it is a condescension, because the means receive all their efficiency from his power, not his power from the means. And the power of God is absolutely independent of all that is exterior to his own all-perfect nature.</p>
<p>The  power  of  God  is  the  power  of  his  all-perfect,  self-existent essence.  He  has  absolutely  unlimited  power  to  do  whatsoever  his nature  determines  him  to  will.  But  this  power  cannot  be  directed against  his  nature.  The  ultimate  principles  of  reason  and  of  moral right  and  wrong  are  not  products  of  the  divine  power,  but  are principles of the divine nature. God cannot change the nature of right and  wrong,  etc.,  because  he  did  not  make  himself,  and  these  have their  determination  in  his  own  eternal  perfections.  He  cannot  act unwisely or unrighteously; not for want of the power as respects the act, but for want of will, since God is eternally, immutably, and most freely and spontaneously, wise and righteous.</p>
<p>God's omnipotence is illustrated, but never exhausted, in his works of creation and providence. God's power is exercised at his will, but there ever remains an infinite reserve of possibility lying back of the actual exercise of power, since the Creator always infinitely transcends his creation.</p>
<p>(6.) The absolutely perfect goodness of God. The moral perfection of God  is one absolutely perfect righteousness. Relatively to his creatures  his  infinite  moral  perfection  always  presents  that  aspect which his infinite wisdom decides to be appropriate to the case. He is not alternately merciful and just, nor partially merciful and partially just,  but  eternally  and  perfectly  merciful  and  just.  Both  are  right; both  are  equally  and  spontaneously  in  his  nature;  and  both  are perfectly  and  freely  harmonized  by  the  infinite  wisdom  of  that nature.</p>
<p>His  goodness  includes  (a)  Benevolence,  or  goodness  viewed  as  a disposition to promote the happiness of his sensitive creatures; (b) Love, or goodness viewed as a disposition to promote the happiness of intelligent creatures, and  to regard with complacency  their excellences; (c) Mercy, or goodness exercised toward the miserable; (d) Grace, or goodness exercised toward the undeserving.</p>
<p>The  grace  of  God  toward  the  undeserving  evidently  rests  upon  his sovereign will (Matt. xi. 26; Rom. ix. 15), and can be assured to us only by means of a positive revelation. Neither reason nor conscience nor  observation  of  nature  can  assure  us,  independently  of  his  own special revelation, that he will be gracious to the guilty. Our duty is to forgive  injuries;  we  as  individuals  have  nothing  to  do  with  either forgiving or pardoning sin. That God's goodness is absolutely perfect and  inexhaustible  is  proved  from  universal  experience,  as  well  as from  Scripture.  James  i.  17;  v.  11.  It  is  exercised,  however,  not  in making the happiness of his creatures indiscriminately and unconditionally a chief end, but is regulated by his wisdom in order to  the  accomplishment  of  the  supreme  ends  of  his  own  glory  and their excellence.</p>
<p>(7.)  God  is  absolutely  true.  This  is  a  common  property  of  all  the divine perfections and actions. His knowledge is absolutely accurate; his wisdom infallible; his goodness and justice perfectly true to the standard of his own nature. In the exercise of all his properties God is  always  self-consistent.  He  is  also  always  absolutely  true  to  his creatures  in  all  his  communications,  sincere  in  his  promises  and threatenings, and faithful in their fulfillment.</p>
<p>This lays the foundation for all rational confidence in the constitution  of  our  own  natures  and  in  the  order  of  the  external world, as well as in a divinely-accredited, supernatural revelation. It guarantees the validity of the information of our senses, the truth of the  intuitions  of  reason  and  conscience,  the  correctness  of  the inferences  of  the  understanding,  and  the  general  credibility  of human testimony, and pre-eminently the reliability of every word of the inspired Scriptures.</p>
<p>(8.)  The  infinite  justice  of  God.  This,  viewed  absolutely,  is  the  allperfect righteousness of God's being considered in himself.  Viewed relatively, it is his infinitely righteous nature exercised, as the moral Governor of his intelligent creatures. in the imposition of righteous laws,  and.  in  their  righteous  execution.  It  appears  in  the  general administration of his government viewed as a whole, and distributively  in  his  dealing  to  individuals  that  treatment  which righteously  belongs  to  them,  according  to  his  own  covenants  and their  own  deserts.  God  is  most  willingly  just,  but  his  justice  is  no more an optional product of his will than is his self-existent being. It is an immutable principle of his divine constitution. He is "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity." Hab. i. 13. "He cannot deny himself." 2 Tim. ii. 13. God does not make his demands just by willing them, but he wills them because they are just.</p>
<p>The infinite righteousness of his immutable being determines him to regard  and  to  treat  all  sin  as  intrinsically  hateful  and  deserving  of punishment. The punishment of sin and its consequent discouragement is an obvious benefit to the subjects of his government in general. It is a revelation of righteousness in God, and a powerful stimulant to moral excellence in them.</p>
<p>But God hates sin because it is intrinsically hateful, and punishes it because such punishment is intrinsically righteous. This is proved --</p>
<ul>
<li>(a.) From  the  direct  assertions  of  Scripture:  "To  me  belongeth vengeance  and  recompense."  Deut.  xxxii.  35.  "According  to  their deeds, accordingly he will repay." Isa. lix. 18, "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you." 2 Thess. i. 6. "Knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death." Rom. i. 32.</li>
<li>(b.)  The Scriptures teach that the vicarious suffering of the penalty due  to  his  people  by  Christ,  as  their  substitute,  was  absolutely necessary to enable God to continue " just " and at the same time " the  justifier  of  him  which  believeth  in  Jesus."  Rom.  iii.  26.  "  If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. ii. 21. "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness  should  have  been  by  the  law."  Gal.  iii.  21.  That  is,  if God  could  have,  in  consistency  with  justice,  pardoned  sinners without an expiation, " verily" he would not have sacrificed. his own Son " in vain."</li>
<li>(c.)  It  is  a  universal  judgment  of  awakened  sinners  that  their  sin deserves punishment, and that immutable righteousness demands it. And this is the sentence universally pronounced by the moral sense of enlightened men with regard to all crime.</li>
<li>(d.) The same changeless principle of righteousness was in culcated by  all  the  divinely  appointed  sacrifices  of  the  Mosaic  dispensation: "Almost  all  things  by  the  law  are  purged  with  blood;  and  without shedding  of  blood  is  no  remission."  Heb.  ix.  22.  It  has  also  been illustrated  in  the  sacrificial  rites  of  all  heathen  nations,  and  in  all human laws and penalties.</li>
<li>(9.) The infinite holiness of God. Sometimes this term is applied to God  to  express  his  perfect  purity:  "Sanctify  yourselves,  and  be  ye holy; for I am holy." Lev. xi. 44. In that case it is an element of  his perfect  righteousness.  "  The  Lord  is  righteous  in  all  his  ways,  and holy  in  all  his  works."  Ps.  cxlv.  17.  Sometimes  it  expresses  his transcendently august and venerable majesty, which is the result of</li>
</ul>
<p>all  his  harmonious  and  blended  perfections  in  one  perfection  of absolute  and  infinite  excellence:  "And  one  cried  to  another,  Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory." Isa. vi. 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God is self-existent and absolutely independent, the sole support, proprietor,  and  sovereign  disposer,  of  his  creatures.  Since  God  is eternal and the creator out of nothing of all things that exist besides himself, it follows (1.) That his own being must have the cause of its existence  in  itself  --  that  is,  that  he  is  self-existent;  (2.)  That  he  is absolutely  independent,  in  his  being,  purposes,  and  actions,  of  all other beings; and (3.) That all other beings of right belong to him, and in fact  are  absolutely  dependent  upon  him  in  their  being,  and subject to him in their actions and destinies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The sovereignty of God is his absolute right to govern and dispose of the world of his own hands according to his own good pleasure. This sovereignty rests not in his will abstractly, but in his adorable person. Hence  it  is  an  infinitely  wise,  righteous,  benevolent,  and  powerful sovereignty, unlimited by anything outside of his own perfections.</p>
<p>The  grounds  of  his  sovereignty  are  --  -(1.)  His  infinite  superiority. (2.) His absolute ownership of all things, as created by him. (3.) The perpetual and absolute dependence of all things upon him for being, and of all intelligent creatures for blessedness, Dan. iv. 25, 35; Rev. iv. 11.</p>
<p>SECTION III. In the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one  substance,  power,  and  eternity:  God  the  Father,  God  the  Son, and God the Holy Ghost.[38] The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; [39] the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. [40]</p>
<p>[38] 1 John v. 7; Matt. iii. 16, 17; Matt. xxviii. 19; 2 Cor. xiii. 14; [39] John i. 14, 18; [40] John xv. 26; Gal. iv. 6.</p>
<p>Having before shown that there is but one living and true God, and that  his  essential  properties  embrace  all  perfections,  this  section asserts in addition --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each equally that one God; and that the indivisible divine essence and all divine perfections and prerogatives belong to each in the same sense and degree.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  these  titles,  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  are  not  different names  of  the  same  person  in  different  relations,  but  of  different persons.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  these  three  divine  persons  are  distinguished  from  one another by certain persona1 properties, and are revealed in a certain order of subsistence and of operation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These  propositions  embrace  the  Christian  doctrine  of  the  Trinity (three  in  unity),  which  is  no  part  of  natural  religion,  though  most clearly revealed in the inspired Scriptures -- indistinctly, perhaps, in the Old  Testament,  but  with  especial  definiteness  in  the  New Testament.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  are  each  equally  the  one  God;  and the indivisible divine essence and all divine perfections and prerogatives belong to each in the same sense and degree.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there is but one God, the infinite and the absolute First Cause, his essence, being spiritual, cannot be divided. If then Father,  Son, and Holy Ghost, are that one God, they must each equally consist of that same essence. And since the attributes of God are the inherent properties of his essence, they are inseparable from that essence; and it  follows  that  if  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  consist  of  the  same numerical essence, they must have the same identical attributes in common -- that is, there is common to them the one intelligence and the one will, etc.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are full of the evidences of this fundamental truth. It has never been questioned whether the Father is God. That the Son is the true God is proved by the following considerations: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) Christ existed before he was born of the Virgin. (a) He was with the Father "before the world was." John viii. 58; xvii. 5. (b) "He came into the world"--" He came down from heaven." John iii. 13; xvi. 28.</li>
<li>(2.) All the names and titles of God are constantly applied to Christ, and to none others except to the Father and the Spirit: as Jehovah, Jer. xxiii. 6; -- mighty God, everlasting Father, Isa, ix. 6; -- God, John i. 1; Heb. i. 8; -- God over all, Rom. ix. 5; -- the true God, and eternal life, 1 John v. 20; -- the Alpha and the Omega, the Almighty, Rev. i. 8.</li>
<li>(3.)  All  divine  attributes  are  predicated  of  him:  Eternity,  John  viii. 58; xvii. 5; Rev. i. 8; xxii. 13; -- immutability, Heb. i. 10, 11; xiii. 8; -omnipresence, Matt. xviii. 20; John iii. 13; -- omniscience, Matt. xi. 27; John ii. 24, 25; Rev. ii. 28; -- omnipotence, John v. 17; Heb. i. 3.</li>
<li>(4.)  The  Scriptures  attribute  all  Divine  works  to  Christ:  Creation, John  i.  3  --  10;  Col.  i.  10,  17;  --  preservation  and  providential government,  Heb.  i.  3;  Col.  i.  17;  Matt.  xxviii.  18;  --  the  final judgment, John v. 22; Matt. xxv. 31, 32; 2 Cor. v. 10; -- giving eternal life, John  x. 28; --sending  the Holy  Ghost,  John  xvi. 7; --sanctification, Eph. v. 25 -- 27.</li>
<li>(5.)  The  Scriptures  declare  that  divine  worship  should  be  paid  to him: Heb. i. 6; Rev. i. 5, 6; v. 11, 12; 1 Cor. i. 2; John v. 23. Men are to be baptized into the name of Jesus, as well as into the names of the Father  and  the  Holy  Ghost.  The  grace  of  Jesus  is  invoked  in  the apostolical benediction.</li>
</ul>
<p>That the Holy Ghost is the true God is proved in a similar manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  He  is  called  God.  What  the  Spirit  says  Jehovah  says.  Compare Isa. vi. 8, 9, with Acts xxviii. 25, 26; and Jer. xxxi. 33 with Heb. x. 15, 16. To lie to the Holy Ghost is to lie to God. Acts v. 3, 4.</li>
<li>(2.)  Divine  perfections  are  ascribed  to  him:  Omniscience,  1  Cor.  ii. 10,  ll;  --  omnipresence,  Ps.  cxxxix.  7;  --  omnipotence,  Luke  i.  35; Rom. viii. 11.</li>
<li>(3.)  Divine  works  are  attributed  to  him:  Creation,  Job  xxvi.  13;  Ps. civ.  30;  --  miracles,  1  Cor.  xii.  9  --  11;  --  regeneration,  John  iii.  6; Titus iii. 5.</li>
<li>(4.) Divine worship is to be paid to him. His gracious influences are invoked  in  the  apostolical  benediction.  2  Cor.  xiii.  14.  We  are baptized into his name. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is never forgiven. Matt. xii. 31, 32.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>These titles, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not the names of the same person in different relations, but of different persons.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since  there  is  but  one  indivisible  and  inalienable  spiritual  essence, which  is  common  to  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  and  since  they have in common one infinite intelligence, power, will, etc., when we say they are distinct persons we do not mean that one is as separate from the other as one human person is from every other. Their mode of  subsistence  in  the  one  substance  must  ever  continue  to  us  a profound mystery, as it transcends all analogy. All that is revealed to us is,  that  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost, stand  so  distinguished and related that,--</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  They  use  mutually  the  personal  pronouns  I,  thou,  he,  when speaking to or about each other. Thus Christ continually addresses the Father, and speaks of the Father and of the Holy Ghost: "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter," John xiv. 16; "And now, 0 Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was," John xvii. 5. Thus Christ speaks of the Holy Ghost: "I will send him;" "He shall</li>
</ul>
<p>testify of me;" " Whom the Father will send in my name," John xiv. 26, and xv. 26.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) That they mutually love one another, act upon and through one another, and take counsel together. The Father sends the Son, John xvii.  3;  and  the  Father  and  Son  send  the  Spirit,  Ps.  civ.  30.  The Father  giveth  commandment  to  the  Son,  John  x.  18;  the  Spirit "speaks not of himself "--" he testifies of" and "glorifies" Christ. John xv. 26; xvi. 13-15.</li>
<li>(3.) That they are eternally mutually related as Father and Son and Spirit. That is, the Father is the Father of the Son, and the Son the Son of the Father, and the Spirit the Spirit of the Father and of the Son.</li>
<li>(4.) That they work together in a perfectly harmonious economy of operations  upon  the  creation;  --  the  Father  creating  and  sitting supreme in the general administration; the Son becoming incarnate in human  nature, and, as the Theanthropos, discharging the functions  of  mediatorial  prophet,  priest,  and  king;  the  Holy  Ghost making  his  grace  omnipresent,  and  applying  it  to  the  souls  and bodies of his members: the Father the absolute origin and source of life and law; the Son the revealer; the Holy Ghost the executor.</li>
</ul>
<p>There  are  a  number  of  Scripture  passages  in  which  all  the  three persons are set forth as distinct and yet as divine: Matt. xxviii. 19; 2 Cor. xiii. 14; Matt. iii. 13-17; John xv. 26, etc.; 1 John v. 7.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>These three divine persons are distinguished from one another by certain  personal  properties,  and  are  revealed  in  a  certain  order  of subsistence and of operation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The "attributes" of God are the properties of the divine essence, and therefore common to each of the three persons, who are "the same in substance," and therefore "equal in power and glory." The "properties"  of  each  divine  person,  on  the  other  hand,  are  those peculiar  modes  of  personal  subsistence,  and  that  peculiar  order  of operation,  which  distinguish  each  from  the  others,  and  determine the relation of each to the others. This is chiefly expressed to us by the personal  names  by  which  they  are  revealed.  The  peculiar personal property of the first person is expressed by the title Father. As a person he is eternally the Father of his only begotten Son. The peculiar personal property of the second person is expressed by the title  Son.  As  a  person  he  is  eternally  the  only  begotten  Son  of  the Father, and hence the express image of his person, and the eternal Word in the beginning with God. The peculiar property of the third person  is  expressed  by  the  title  Spirit.  This  cannot  express  his essence, because his essence is also the essence of the Father and the Son. It must express his eternal personal relation to the other divine persons, because he is as a person constantly designated as the Spirit of  the  Father  and  the  Spirit  of  the  Son.  They  are  all  spoken  of  in Scripture-in  a  constant  order;  the  Father  first,  the  Son  second,  the Spirit third. The Father sends and operates through both the Son and the Spirit. The Son sends and operates through the Spirit. Never the reverse in either  case.  The  Son  is  sent  by,  acts  for,  and  reveals  the Father. The Spirit is sent by, acts for, and reveals both the Father and the Son. The persons are as eternal as the essence, equal in honour, power, and glory. Three persons, they are one God, being identical in essence and divine perfections. " I and my Father are one." John x. 30.  "The  Father  is  in  me  and  I  in  him."  John  x.  38.  "He  that  hath seen the Son, hath seen the Father." John xiv. 9 -- 11.</p>
<p>The most ancient and universally accepted statement of all the points involved in the doctrine of the Trinity, is to be found in the Creed of the  Council  of  Nice,  A.D.  325,  as  amended  by  the  Council  of Constantinople, A.D. 381.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-three-of-gods-eternal-decree">Chapter Three Of God's Eternal Decree<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-three-of-gods-eternal-decree" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SECTION 1: GOD from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass:(l) yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, (2)  nor  is  violence  offered  to  the  will  of  the  creatures,  nor  is  the liberty  or  contingency  of  second  causes  taken  away,  but  rather established.(3)</p>
<p>SECTION 2: ALTHOUGH God knows whatsoever may or can come to  pass  upon  all  supposed  conditions;(4)  yet  hath  he  not  decreed anything  because  he  foresaw  it  as  future,  or  as  that  which  would come to pass upon such conditions.(5)</p>
<p>(1) Eph. 1:11; Rom. 11:33; Heb. 6:17; Rom. 9:15,18. (2) James 1:13,17; 1 John 1:5. (3) Acts 2:23; Matt. 17:12; Acts 4:27,28; John 19:11; Prov. 16:33.  (4)  Acts  15:18;  1  Sam.  23:11,12;  Matt.  11:21,23.  (5)  Rom. 9:11,13,16,18.</p>
<p>These Sections affirm the following propositions:--</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>God has had from eternity an unchangeable plan with reference to his  creatures.  As  an  infinitely  intelligent  Creator  and  providential Ruler, God must have had a definite purpose with reference to the being and destination of all that he has created, comprehending in one all-perfect system his chief end therein, and all subordinate ends and means in reference to that chief end. And since he is an eternal and  unchangeable  Being,  his  plan  must  have  existed  in  all  its elements,  perfect  and  unchangeable,  from  eternity.  Since  he  is  an infinite,  eternal,  unchangeable,  and  absolutely  wise,  powerful,  and sovereign Person, his purposes must partake of the essential attributes of his own being. And since God's intelligence is absolutely perfect and his plan is eternal, since his ultimate end is revealed to be the single one of his own glory, and the whole work of creation and providence is observed to form one system, it follows that his plan is also  single-one  all-comprehensive  intention,  providing  for  all  the means and conditions as well as the ends selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  plan  of  God  comprehends  and  determines  all  things  and events of every kind that come to pass.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  This  is  rendered  certain  from  the  fact  that  all  God's  works  of creation and providence constitute one system. No event is isolated, either in the physical or moral world, either in heaven or on earth. All  of  God's  supernatural  revelations  and  every  advance  of  human science conspire to make this truth conspicuously luminous. Hence the original intention which determines one event must also determine  every  other  event  related  to  it,  as  cause,  condition,  or consequent, direct and indirect, immediate and remote. Hence, the plan  which  determines  general  ends  must  also  determine  even  the minutest element comprehended in the system of which those ends are  parts.  The  free  actions  of  free  agents  constitute  an  eminently important and effective element in the system of things. If the plan of God did not determine events of this class, he could make nothing certain, and his government of the world would be made contingent and dependent, and all his purposes fallible and mutable.</li>
<li>(2) The Scriptures expressly declare this truth-</li>
<li>(a) Of the whole system in general. He "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will" (Eph. 1:11).</li>
<li>(b) Of fortuitous events (Prov. 16:33; Matt. 10:29,30).</li>
<li>(c) Of the free actions of men. "The king's heart is in the hands of the LORD, as  the  rivers  of  water:  he  turneth  it  whithersoever  he  will" (Prov. 21:1). "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them" (Eph. 2:10). "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).</li>
</ol>
<p>(d)  Of  the  sinful  actions  of  men.  "Him,  being  delivered  by  the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain" (Acts 2:23). "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  for  to  do  whatsoever  thy  hand  and  thy  counsel determined before to be done" (Acts 4:27,28). (Compare Gen. 37:28 with Gen. 45:7,8; Isa. 10:5.)</p>
<p>It  must  be  remembered,  however,  that  the  purpose  of  God  with respect to the sinful acts of men and wicked angels is in no degree to cause the evil, nor to approve it, but only to permit the wicked agent to perform it, and then to overrule it for his own most wise and holy ends. The same infinitely perfect and self-consistent decree ordains the  moral law which forbids  and  punishes  all  sin,  and  at  the  same time  permits  its  occurrence,  limiting  and  determining  the  precise channel to which it shall be confined, the precise end to which it shall be  directed,  and  overruling  its  consequences  for  good:  "But  as  for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive" (Gen. 50:20).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This all-comprehensive purpose is not, as a whole nor in any of its constituent elements, conditional. It in no respect depends upon his foresight of events not embraced in and determined by his purpose. It  is  absolutely  sovereign,  depending  only  on  the  "wise  and  holy counsel of his own will."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A very obvious distinction must always be kept in mind between an event being conditioned on other events, and the decree of God with reference  to  that  event  being  conditioned.  Calvinists  believe,  as  all men must, that all events in the system of things depend upon their causes, and are suspended on conditions. That is, if a man does not sow  seed,  he  will  not  reap;  if  he  does  sow,  and  all  the  favorable climatic  influences  are  present,  he  will  reap.  If  a  man  believes,  he shall be saved; if he does not believe, he will not be saved. But the allcomprehensive purpose of God embraces and determines the cause and the conditions, as well as the event suspended upon them. The decree, instead of altering, determines the nature of events, and their mutual  relations.  It  makes  free  actions  free  in  relation  to  their agents, and contingent events contingent in relation to their conditions;  while  at  the  same  time,  it  makes  the  entire  system  of events,  and  every  element  embraced  in  it,  certainly  future.  An absolute decree is one which, while it may  determine many conditional events by determining their conditions, is itself suspended  on  no  condition.  A  conditional  decree  is  one  which determines that a certain event shall happen on condition that some other  undecreed  event  happens,  upon  which  undecreed  event  the decree itself, as well as the event decreed, is suspended.</p>
<p>The Confession in this section teaches that all the decrees of God are unconditional.</p>
<p>All who believe in a divine government agree with Calvinists that the decrees of God relating to events produced by necessary causes are unconditional.  The  only  debate  relates  to  those  decrees  which  are concerned with the free actions of men and of angels. The Socinians and  Rationalists  maintain  that  God  cannot  certainly  foresee  free actions, because from their very nature they are uncertain until they are performed. Arminians admit that he certainly foresees them, but deny  that  he  determines  them.  Calvinists  affirm  that  he  foresees them to be certainly future because he has determined them to be so. The truth of the Calvinist view is proved-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) From the fact that, as shown above, the decrees of God determine all classes of events. If every event that comes to pass is foreordained,  it  is  evident  that  there  is  nothing  left  undetermined upon which the decree can be conditioned.</li>
<li>(2)  Because  the  decrees  of  God  are  sovereign.  This  is  evident-(a) Because  God  is  the  eternal  and  absolute  Creator  of  all  things.  All creatures  exist,  and  are  what  they  are,  and  possess  the  properties peculiar to them, and act under the very conditions in which they act,</li>
</ul>
<p>because of God's plan. (b) It is directly affirmed in Scripture (Dan. 4:35; Isa. 40:13,14; Rom. 9:15-18; Eph. 1:5).</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) God's decree includes and determines the means and conditions upon  which  events  depend,  as  well  as  the  events  themselves: "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,  that  we  should  be  holy"  (Eph.  1:4).  "By  grace  are  ye  saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God" (Eph. 2:8). "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" (2 Thess. 2:13). In the case of Paul's shipwreck, God first promised Paul absolutely that not a life should be lost (Acts 27:24). But Paul said, verse 31, "Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."</li>
<li>(4) The  Scriptures  declare  that the salvation of individuals is conditioned upon the personal act of faith, and at the same time that the  decree  of  God  with  regard  to  the  salvation  of  individuals  rests solely upon "the counsel of his own will," "his own good pleasure." "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil,  that  the  purpose  of  God  according  to  election  might  stand, not  of  works,  but  of  him  that  calleth,"  etc.  (Rom.  9:11).  "Being predestinated  according  to  the  purpose  of  him  who  worketh  all things  after  the  counsel  of  his  own  will"  (Eph.  1:11;  1:5;  Matt. 11:25,26).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The purpose of God is, with reference to all the objects embraced within it, certainly efficacious.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  decree  of  God  is  merely  a  purpose  which  he  executes  in  his works of creation and providence. When it is said that all the decrees of  God  are  certainly  efficacious,  it  is  not  meant  that  they  are  the proximate causes of events, but that they render, under the subsequent economy  of creation and providence, every event embraced in them absolutely certain. This is evident-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) From the nature of God as an infinitely wise and powerful person and absolute sovereign.</li>
<li>(2)  From  the  fact  that  the  decrees  relate  to  all  events  without exception, and are sovereign and unconditional.</li>
<li>(3) The Scriptures declare, with reference to such events, that there is  a  needs-be  that  they  should  happen  as  it  was  determined  (Matt. 16:21; Luke 24:44; 22:22).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  purpose  must  in  all  things  be  perfectly  consistent  with  his own most wise, benevolent, and holy nature.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  is  a  self-evident  truth  from  the  nature  of  God  as  an  eternal, absolutely  perfect,  and  unchangeable  Being.  His  decrees  must  be absolutely perfect in wisdom and righteousness. The problem of the permission of sin is to us insoluble, because unexplained. The fact is certain,  the  reason  beyond  discovery.  If  God  be  infinitely  wise  and powerful,  he  might  have  prevented  it.  It  is evident  that it is consistent with absolute righteousness to permit it and to overrule it. The  Arminian  admits  that  God  foresaw  that  sin  and  misery  would certainly  eventuate  upon  the  conditions  of  creation  he  established. He  is  therefore  as  unable  as  the  Calvinist  is  to  explain  why  God, notwithstanding  that certain knowledge,  did not change  those conditions.</p>
<p>It remains certain, however, that God is not the cause of sin because He  is  absolutely  holy.  Moreover,  sin  is  essentially  defined  as  a violation of God's will (ovomia), and God cannot violate His own will. Also, having free agency we are responsible for our actions. We must assert that God has permitted sin for the purpose of overruling it in the  interests  of  righteousness  and  benevolence,  for  His  own  glory and our highest good.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  purpose of God is in all things perfectly consistent  with  the nature and the mode of action of the creatures severally embraced within it.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="this-is-certain-">This is certain-<a class="headerlink" href="#this-is-certain-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>(1) Because the one eternal, self-consistent, all-comprehensive</li>
</ul>
<p>purpose of God at the same time determines the nature of the agent, his proper mode of action, and each action that shall eventuate. As God's  purpose  cannot  be  inconsistent  with  itself,  the  element  of  it determining the nature of the agent cannot be inconsistent with the element of it determining any particular action of the agent.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2)  Because  the  decrees  of  God  are  not  the  proximate  causes  of events; they only make a given event certainly future. It provides that free  agents  shall  be  free  agents,  and  free  actions  free  actions;  and that a given free agent shall exist, and that he shall freely perform a certain free action under certain conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now,  that  a  given  free  action  is  certainly  future,  is  obviously  not inconsistent  with  the  perfect  freedom  of  the  agent  in  that  act:  (a) Because  all  admit  that  God  certainly  foreknows  the  free  actions  of free agents, and if so, they must be certainly future, although free. (b) God's actions are certainly holy, though free; and the same is true of all  glorified  spirits  in  heaven.  (c)  The  actions  of  the  devil,  and  of finally reprobate men and angels, will forever be certainly wicked, yet free and responsible.</p>
<p>SECTION 3: BY the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels(6) are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death.(7)</p>
<p>SECTION  4:  THESE  angels  and  men,  thus  predestinated  and foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.(8)</p>
<p>SECTION  5:  THOSE  of  mankind  that  are  predestinated  unto  life, God,  before  the  foundation  of  the  world  was  laid,  according  to  his eternal  and  immutable  purpose,  and  the  secret  counsel  and  good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory,(9) out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto;(10) and all to the praise of his glorious grace.(11)</p>

<p>The preceding sections having affirmed that the eternal, sovereign, immutable,  unconditional  decree  of  God  determines  all  events  of every  class  that  come  to  pass,  these  sections  proceed  to  affirm,  by way of specification, the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  decree  of  God  determines  that  out  of  the  mass  of  fallen humanity  certain  individuals  shall  attain  to  eternal  salvation,  and that the rest shall be left to be dealt with justly for their sins.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Socinian holds that the free acts of men, being in  their  nature uncertain, cannot be foreknown as certainly future. Since, therefore, God  does  not  foreknow  who  will  repent  and  believe,  his  election amounts to no more than his general purpose to save all believers as a class.</p>
<p>The Arminian holds that God, foreseeing from all eternity who will repent  and  believe,  elects  those  individuals  to  eternal  life  on  that condition of faith and repentance thus certainly foreknown.</p>
<p>The  Calvinist  holds  that  God  has  elected  certain  individuals  to eternal life, and all the means and conditions thereof, on the ground of his  sovereign  good  pleasure.  He  chooses  them  to  faith  and repentance, and not because of their faith and repentance. That God does choose individuals to eternal life is certain.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The subjects are always spoken of in Scripture as individuals: "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48; 2 Thess. 2:13; Eph. 1:4).</li>
<li>(2) The names of the elect are said to be "written in heaven," and to be "in the book of life" (Phil. 4:3; Heb. 12:23).</li>
<li>(3)  The  blessings  to  which  men  are  elected  are  such  as  pertain  to individuals, not to communities; and they are represented as elected to these spiritual qualifications, and not because they belong to the class which possesses them. They are elected "to salvation," "to the adoption of sons," "to be holy and without blame before him in love" (2 Thess. 2:13; Gal. 4:4,5; Eph. 1:4).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This election is unchangeable. This is self-evident.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is not conditioned upon foreseen faith or repentance, but in each case upon sovereign grace and personal love, according to the secret counsel of his will.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) It is expressly declared not to rest upon works; but foreseen faith and repentance are works (Rom. 11:4-7; 2 Tim. 1:9).</li>
<li>(2)  Faith  and  repentance  are  expressly  said  to  be  the  fruits  of election,  and  consequently  cannot  be  its  conditions.  They  are  also declared  to  be  the  gifts of God,  and  cannot  therefore  be  the conditions  upon  which  he  suspends  his  purpose  (Eph.  2:10;  1:4;  1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 2:8; Acts 5:31; 1 Cor. 4:7). "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that  of  all  which  he  hath  given  me  I  should  lose  nothing"  (John 6:37,39). "But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep" (John 10:26). "And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48).</li>
<li>(3)  The  Scriptures  represent  men  by  nature  as  "dead  in  trespasses and  sins";  and  faith  and  repentance  as  the  exercise  of  regenerated souls;  and  regeneration  as  the  work  of  God-a  "new  birth,"  a  "new creation,"  a  "quickening  from  the  dead."  Faith  and  repentance, therefore,  must  be  conditioned  upon  God's  purpose,  and  cannot condition it (Eph. 2:1; John 3:3,5; Eph. 2:5,10).</li>
<li>(4) The Scriptures expressly say that election is conditioned on the "good  pleasure  of  God's  will":  "Having  predestinated  us  unto  the adoption  of  children  by  Jesus  Christ  to  himself,  according  to  the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace...In whom  also  we  have  obtained  an  inheritance,  being  predestinated according  to  the  purpose  of  him  who  worketh  all  things  after  the counsel of his own will" (Eph. 1:5,11; Matt. 11:25,26; John 15:16,19).</li>
<li>(5)  God claims the right of sovereign, unconditional election as his prerogative:  "Hath  not  the  potter  power  over  the  clay,  of  the  same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?" (Rom. 9:21). If of the same lump, the difference is not in the clay. "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy" (Rom. 9:16).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The ultimate end or motive of God in election is the praise of his glorious  grace.  This  is  expressly  asserted  in  Eph.  1:5,6,12.  In  the chapter on Creation it will be shown that the final end of God in all his works, as a whole, is the manifestation of his own glory. If it be the  final  end  of  the  whole,  it  must  be  the  end  also  of  the  special destination of all the parts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 6: AS God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto.(12) Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ;(13) are effectually called unto faith in Christ  by  his  Spirit  working  in  due  season;  are  justified,  adopted, sanctified,(14)  and  kept  by  his  power  through  faith  unto  salvation. (15)  Neither  are  any  other  redeemed  by  Christ,  effectually  called, justified, adopted, sanctified and saved, but the elect only.(16)</p>
<p>(12) 1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:4,5; 2:10; 2 Thess. 2:13. (13) 1 Thess. 5:9,10; Tit. 2:14. (14) Rom. 8:30; Eph. 1:5; 2 Thess. 2:13. (15) 1 Pet. 1:5. (16) John 17:9; Rom. 8:28; John 6:64,65; 10:26; 8:47; 1 John 2:19.</p>
<p>This section affirms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That although the decree of God is one eternal, all-comprehensive intention, the several elements embraced  within  it necessarily sustain the relation to one another of means to ends. In determining the ends he intends to accomplish, God at the same time determines the  means  by  which  he  intends  to  accomplish  them.  And  God's purpose  with  respect  to  the  end  necessarily,  in  the  logical  order, takes precedence of and gives direction to his purpose with respect to the means.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That, in the matter of the redemption of men, the end which God determined  was  the  salvation  of  certain  individuals,  called  "the elect"; and that he appointed, as means to that end, redemption by Christ, effectual calling, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance in grace unto death.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That as the means are intended to effect the end, so they are not to be exercised in the case of any whose salvation has not been adopted as that end. None but the elect are redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, or justified, or adopted, or sanctified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the purposes of God do sustain the relation to one another of means to ends is evident-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  From  the  fact  that  his  purposes  are  the  product  of  an  infinite intelligence the very office of which is to coordinate a great system of means in the accomplishment of a great design.</li>
<li>(2) God accomplishes his eternal purposes in his works of creation and  providence,  and  in  the  economy  of  both  he  habitually  uses systems of means in subordination to predetermined ends.</li>
<li>(3) All the events decreed as a matter of fact eventuate in the relation of  means in subordination to ends. They must therefore have been embraced in the same order in the divine decree.</li>
<li>(4)  God explicitly  tells  us  that  he  determines  one  thing  in  order  to accomplish  another.  He  predestinates  men  to  salvation,  "through</li>
</ul>
<p>sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth," to "the praise of the glory of his grace" (2 Thess. 2:13; Eph. 1:6).</p>
<ol>
<li>That the gift of Christ to make atonement for sin, and of the Holy Ghost to regenerate and sanctify, are in the divine designed as means to  accomplish  his  purpose  to  secure  the  salvation  of  the  elect,  has been  doubted  by  some  theologians,  but  is  explicitly  affirmed  both positively and negatively in this section of the Confession. In the time that this Confession was written, the phrase "to redeem" was used in the same sense in which we now use the phrase "to make atonement for." The  Confession affirms, first, positively, that Christ was eternally appointed to make atonement as a means of executing the purpose to save the elect; and second, negatively, that he has made atonement  for  none  others.  The  class  of  theologians  who  do  not agree  with  the  Confession  at  this  point,  view  the  purposes  of  God, with respect to man's salvation and the gift of Christ to be a Savior, as sustaining respectively the following order: Out of infinite pity and universal benevolence, God determined to give his Son to die for the redemption from the curse of the law of all mankind, ruined by the fall; but, foreseeing that if left to themselves all men would certainly reject Christ and be lost, God, in order to carry out and apply his plan of  human  redemption,  and  moved  by  a  special  love  to  certain persons, elected them out of the mass of mankind to be recipients of the special effectual grace of the Holy Ghost, and thus to salvation. The doctrine taught in the Confession and held by the great body of the  Reformed  Churches  is,  that  God,  moved  by  a  special  personal love,  elected  certain  men  out  of  the  mass  of  the  fallen  race  to salvation, and in order to accomplish that purpose he determined to send Christ to die for them and the Holy Ghost to renew and sanctify them. That the view of the Confession is the true one is plain-</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) From the very statement of the case. The gift of Christ to die for the elect is a very adequate means to accomplish the decree of their salvation. But, on the other hand, the decree to give the efficacious influences  of  the  Holy  Ghost  only  to  the  elect  is  a  very  inadequate means  of  accomplishing  the  purpose  of  redeeming  all  men  by  the sacrifice of Christ. A purpose to save all and a purpose to save only some could not coexist in the divine mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) All the purposes of God, being unchangeable, self-consistent, and certainly efficacious, must perfectly correspond to the events which come to pass in time. He must have predestinated to salvation those and those only who are as a matter of fact saved; and he must have intended  that  Christ  should  redeem  those  and  those  only  who  are redeemed.  God's  purpose  in  the  gift  of  Christ  cannot  be  in  any respect in vain. (3) Christ says explicitly, "I lay down my life for the sheep" (John 10:15).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>None but the elect are redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, or justified, or adopted, or sanctified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  is  only  the  negative  statement  of  the  same  truth,  designed  to make the positive affirmation of it the more explicit and emphatic.</p>
<p>The doctrine as to the design of God in the sacrifice of Christ is stated again in  Chapter  8.  Section  8.  of  the  Confession,  and  will  be  more appropriately stated and discussed in that place.</p>
<p>SECTION 7: THE rest of mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable  counsel  of  his  own  will,  whereby  he  extendeth  or withholdeth  mercy  as  he  pleaseth,  for  the  glory  of  his  sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.(17)</p>
<ul>
<li>(17)  Matt.  11:25,26;  Rom.  9:17,18,21,22;  2  Tim.  2:19,20;  Jude  4;  1 Pet. 2:8.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section teaches the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That as God has sovereignly destinated certain persons, called the elect,  through  grace  to  salvation,  so  he  has  sovereignly  decreed  to withhold  his  grace  from  the  rest;  and  that  this  withholding  rests upon the unsearchable counsel of his own will, and is for the glory of his sovereign power.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  God  has  consequently  determined  to  treat  all  those  left  in their  sins  with  exact  justice  according  to  their  own  deserts,  to  the praise of his justice, which demands the punishment of all unexpiated sin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This decree of reprobation, as it is called, is the aspect which God's eternal purpose presents in its relation to that portion of the human family which shall be finally condemned for their sins.</p>
<p>Reprobation consists of two elements, the negative and the positive. In its negative aspect God does not elect the reprobate, but "passes over" him; in this God is absolutely sovereign, resting upon His good pleasure  alone,  since  those  passed  over  are  no  worse  than  those elected. Positively, reprobation is not sovereign, but purely judicial, since God has determined to treat the reprobate according to what they deserve.</p>
<p>This  doctrine,  instead  of  being  inconsistent  with  the  principles  of absolute  justice,  necessarily  follows  from  the  application  of  those principles to the case in hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  All  men  alike  are  "by  nature  the  children  of  wrath,"  and  justly obnoxious to the penalty of the law antecedently to the gift of Christ to  be  their  Savior.  It  is  because  they  are  in  this  condition  that vicarious  satisfaction  of  divine  justice  was  absolutely  necessary  in order to the salvation of any, otherwise, the apostle says, "Christ is dead in  vain."  Hence  if  any  are  to  be  saved,  justice  itself  demands that  their  salvation  shall  be  recognized  as  not  their  right,  but  a sovereign concession on the part of God. None have a natural right to salvation. And the salvation of one cannot give a right to salvation to another.</li>
<li>(2) Salvation is declared to be in its very essence a matter of grace; and if of grace, the selection of its subjects is inalienably a matter of divine discretion (Lam. 3:22; Rom. 4:4; 11:6; Eph. 1:5-7; John 3:16; 1 John 3:16; 4:10).</li>
</ul>
<p>This doctrine as above stated is true-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Because  it  is  necessarily  involved  in  the  scriptural  doctrine  of election taught in the preceding sections.</li>
<li>(2) It is expressly taught in Scripture: "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth" (Rom. 9:18; 1 Pet. 2:8; Rev. 13:8; Jude 4).</li>
<li>(3) God asserts the right involved as his righteous prerogative: "Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? Who art thou that repliest against God? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same  lump  to  make  one  vessel  unto  honour,  and  another  unto dishonour? What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory  on  the  vessels  of  mercy,  which  he  had  afore  prepared  unto glory?" (Rom. 9:19-23).</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 8: THE doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care,(18) that men attending  the  will of God  revealed  in  his  Word,  and  yielding obedience  thereunto,  may,  from  the  certainty  of  their  effectual vocation,  be  assured  of  their  eternal  election.(19)  So  shall  this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of God, (20) and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation, to all that sincerely obey the gospel.(21)</p>
<ul>
<li>(18) Rom. 9:20; 11:33; Deut. 29:29. (19) 2 Pet. 1:10. (20) Eph. 1:6; Rom. 11:33. (21) Rom. 11:5,6,20; 2 Pet. 1:10; Rom. 8:33; Luke 10:20.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section teaches that the high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care. This necessity arises from the  fact  that  it  is  often  abused,  and  that  its  proper  use  is  in  the highest degree important.</p>
<p>The  principle  of  divine  sovereignty  in  the  distribution  of  grace  is certainly revealed in Scripture, is not difficult of comprehension; and is of  great  practical  use  to  convince  men  of  the  greatness  and independence of God, of the certain efficacy of his grace and security of his promises, and of their own sin and absolute dependence. But the  philosophy  of  the  relation  of  his  sovereign  purpose  to  the  free agency  of  the  creature,  and  to  the  permission  of  moral  evil,  is  not revealed  in  the  Scriptures,  and  cannot  be  discovered  by  human reason,  and  therefore  ought  not  to  be  rashly  meddled  with.  This truth ought not, moreover, to be obtruded out of its due place in the system, which includes the equally certain truths of the freedom of man and the free offers of the gospel to all.</p>
<p>While the principle of sovereign election as lying at the foundation of all  grace  is  thus  clearly  revealed,  the  election  or  nonelection  of particular  persons is  not  revealed  in  the  Scriptures.  The  preceptive and not the decretive will of God is the rule of human duty. Election is first with God, and grace consequent upon it. But with man duty and  grace  are  first,  and  the  inference  of  personal  election  only consequent  upon  the  possession  of  grace.  The  command  to  repent and  believe  is addressed  to  all men  indiscriminately,  and  the obligation  rests  equally  upon  all.  The  concern  of  the  inquirer  is simply  with  the  fact  that  the  grace  is  offered,  and  assured  to  him upon  condition  of  acceptance,  and  with  his  duty  to  accept  and improve it. Afterward it is the great privilege of the believer to make the  fact  of  his  eternal  calling  and  election  sure,  by  adding  to  faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge etc.; for if he do these things he shall never fall (2 Pet. 1:5-10).</p>

<p>SECTION 1: IT pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,(1) for the  manifestation  of  the  glory  of  his  eternal  power,  wisdom,  and goodness,(2)  in  the  beginning,  to  create,  or  make  of  nothing,  the world,  and  all  things  therein,  whether  visible  or  invisible,  in  the space of six days, and all very good.(3)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Heb.  1:2;  John  1:2,3;  Gen.  1:2;  Job  26:13;  33:4.  (2)  Rom.  1:20; Jer.  10:12;  Ps.  104:24;  33:5,6.  (3)  Gen.  1:1-31;  Heb.  11:3;  Col.  1:16; Acts 17:24.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section teaches that matter is not self-existing; that God created the visible universe ex nihilo (from nothing) in six days, all of which was very good, to the manifestation of His own glory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There  is  a  very  obvious  distinction  between  the  substances  of things  and  the  forms  into  which  those  substances  are  disposed.  In our  experience  the  elementary  substances  which  constitute  things are permanent, as oxygen, hydrogen, and the like, while the organic and  inorganic  forms  in  which  they  are  combined  are  constantly changing. That personal spirits and the various forms in which the material elements of the universe are disposed are not self-existent or eternal is self-evident; and the universality, the constancy, and the rapidity of the changes of the latter are rendered more obvious and certain with every advance of science. That the elementary</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>substances of things were created out of nothing was never believed by the ancient heathen philosophers, but is a fundamental principle of Christian Theism. This is proved by the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  The  Scriptures  speak  of  a  time  when  the  world  was  absolutely nonexistent. Christ speaks of the glory "which I had with thee before the world was" (John 17:5,24). "Before thou hadst formed the earth and  the  world,  even  from  everlasting  to  everlasting,  thou  art  God" (Ps. 90:2).</li>
<li>(2)  The  Hebrew word translated "to create," and used by Moses to reveal the fact that God created the world, is the very best afforded by any human language anterior to revelation to express the idea of absolute making. It is introduced at the beginning, of an account of the genesis of the heavens and of the earth. In the beginning-in the absolute beginning-God created all things (heaven and earth). After that there was chaos, and subsequently the Spirit of God, brooding over  the  deep,  brought  the  ordered  world  into  being.  The  creation came before chaos, as chaos before the bringing of things into their present  form.  Therefore  the  substances  of  things  must  have  had  a beginning as well as their present forms.</li>
<li>(3) The Scriptures always attribute the existence of things purely to the will,  "word," "breath" of God, and never, even indirectly, imply the presence of any other element or condition of their being, such as preexisting  matter:  "Through  faith  we  understand  that  the  worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear" (Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:6; 148:5).</li>
<li>(4) If God be not the creator of substance ex nihilo , as well as the former of worlds and of things, he cannot be absolutely sovereign in his decrees or in his works of creation, providence or grace. On every hand  he  would  be  limited  and  conditioned  by  the  self-existent qualities  of  preexistent  substance,  and  their  endless  consequences. But  the  Scriptures  always  represent  God  as  the  absolute  sovereign</li>
</ul>
<p>and proprietor of all things (Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16; Rev. 4:11; Neh. 9:6).</p>
<ul>
<li>(5) The same traces of designed and precalculated correspondences may be clearly observed in the elementary and essential properties and laws of matter that are observed in the adjustments of matter in the existing forms of the world. If the traces of design observed in the existing  forms  of  the  world  prove  the  existence  of  an  intelligent former, for the  same reason the traces of design in the elementary constitution of matter prove the existence of an intelligent creator of those elements out of nothing.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence theologians have distinguished between the creatio prima or first creation of the elementary substance of things ex nihilo , and the creatio secunda  or  second  creation  or  combination  of  the elements and the formation of things, and their mutual adjustments in the system of the universe. This section attributes creation in both of these senses to the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Scriptures  attribute  creation-(1)  To  God  absolutely,  without distinction of person (Gen. 1:1,26). (2) To the Father (1 Cor. 8:6). (3) To the Father through the Son (Heb. 1:2). (4) To the Father through the Spirit (Ps. 104:30). (5) To the Son (John 1:2,3). (6) To the Spirit (Gen. 1:2; Job 33:4).</p>
<p>This  section,  using  the  precise  words  of  Scripture  (Ex.  20:11), declares  that  God  performed  the  work  of  creation,  in  the  sense  of formation and adjustment of the universe in its present order, "in the space  of  six  days."  Since  the  Confession  was  written  the  science  of geology has come into existence, and has brought to light many facts before  unknown  as  to  the  various  conditions  through  which  this world, and probably the stellar universe, have passed previously to the establishment of the present order. These facts remain in their general character unquestionable, and indicate a process of divinely regulated development consuming vast periods of time. In order to adjust the conclusions of that science with the inspired record found in  the  first  chapter  of  Genesis,  some  suppose  that  the  first  verse relates  to  the  creation  of  the  elements  of  things  at  the  absolute beginning, and then, after a vast interval, during which the changes discovered by science took place, the second and subsequent verses narrate how God in six successive days reconstructed and prepared the world and its inhabitants for the residence of man. Others have supposed that the days spoken of are not natural days, but cycles of vast duration. No adjustment thus far suggested has been found to remove all difficulty. The facts which are certain are-(1) The record in Genesis  has  been  given  by  divine revelation, and  therefore  is infallibly true. (2) The book of revelation and the book of nature are both  from  God,  and  will  be  found,  when  both  are  adequately interpreted,  to  coincide  perfectly.  (3)  The  facts  upon  which  the science of geology is based are as yet very imperfectly collected and much more imperfectly  understood.  The  time  has  not  come  yet  in which a profitable comparison and adjustment of the two records can be attempted. (4) The record in Genesis, brief  and  general  as  it  is, was designed and is admirably adapted to lay the foundation of an intelligent faith in Jehovah as the absolute creator and the immediate former and providential ruler of all things. But it was not designed  either  to  prevent  or  to  take  the  place  of  a  scientific interpretation of all existing phenomena, and of all traces of the past history  of  the  world  which  God  allows  men  to  discover.  Apparent discrepancies  in  established  truths  can  have  their  ground  only  in imperfect knowledge. God requires us both to believe and to learn. He  imposes  upon  us  at  present  the  necessity  of  humility  and patience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God  himself  pronounced  all  the  works  of  his  hands,  when completed, very good (Gen. 1:31). This does not mean that finite and material things possessed an absolute perfection, nor even that they possessed the highest excellence consistent with their nature. But it means-(1) That all things  in  this  world  were  at  that  time  excellent according to their respective kinds-the human souls morally excellent  after  the  law  of  moral  agents,  and  the  world  and  all  its organized  inhabitants  excellent  according  to  their  several  natures</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and relations. (2) That each and the whole was perfectly good with reference to the general and special design of God in their creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>With respect to the final end of God in the creation of the universe two distinct opinions have been entertained by theologians: (1) That God proposed for himself as his ultimate end the promotion of the happiness, or as others say the excellence, of his creatures. (2) That God proposed for himself the manifestation of his own glory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  is  obviously  a  question  of  the  highest  importance.  Since  the chief  end  of  every  system  of  means  and  agencies  must  govern  and give  character to the whole system, so our view of the chief end of God  in  his  works  must  give  character  to  all  our  views  as  to  his creative,  providential,  and  gracious  dispensations.  Our  Confession very  explicitly  takes  the  position  that  the  chief  end  of  God  in  his eternal  purposes,  and  in  their  temporal  execution  in  creation  and providence,  is  the  manifestation  of  his  own  glory  (Chapter  3., Sections  3.,  5.,  7.;  Chapter  4.,  Section  1.;  Chapter  5.,  Section  1.; Chapter  6.,  Section  1.;  Chapter  33.,  Section  2.;  Larger  Catechism, questions 12, 18; Shorter Catechism, question 7). That this opinion is true is proved:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The Scriptures explicitly assert that this is the chief end of God in creation (Col. 1:16; Prov. 16:4); and of things as created (Rev. 4:11; Rom. 11:36).</li>
<li>(2)  They teach that the same is the chief end of God in his eternal decrees (Eph. 1:5,6,12).</li>
<li>(3) Also of God's providential and gracious governing and disposing of his creatures (Rom. 9:17,22,23; Eph. 3:10).</li>
<li>(4) It is made the duty of all moral agents to adopt the same as their personal ends in all things (1 Cor. 10:31; 1 Pet. 4:11).</li>
<li>(5) The manifestation of his own glory is intrinsically the highest and worthiest end that God could propose to himself.</li>
<li>(6)  The  highest  attainment  of  this  supreme  end  carries  with  it  the largest possible measure of good to the creature.</li>
<li>(7) God as the absolute creator and sovereign cannot have the final ends or motives of his action exterior to himself. Otherwise all God's actions would be subordinated to the finite and created ends he had adopted as his ultimate objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 2 AFTER God had made all  other  creatures,  he  created man,  male  and  female,(4)  with  reasonable  and  immortal  souls,(5) endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, after his own image,(6) having the law of God written in their hearts,(7) and power  to  fulfill  it;(8)  and  yet  under  a  possibility  of  transgressing, being  left  to  the  liberty  of  their  own  will,  which  was  subject  unto change(9)  Besides  this  law  written  in  their  hearts,  they  received  a command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; (10)  which  while  they  kept,  they  were  happy  in  their  communion with God, and had dominion over the creatures.(11)</p>
<p>(4) Gen. 1:27. (5) Gen. 2:7; Eccl. 12:7; Luke 23:43; Matt. 10:28. (6) Gen. 1:26; Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:24. (7) Rom. 2:14,15. (8) Eccl. 7:29. (9) Gen. 3:6; Eccl. 7:29. (10) Gen. 2:17; 3:8-11,23. (11) Gen. 1:26,28.</p>
<p>We turn in this section to the immediate creation of man by God.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Man  was  created  immediately  by  God,  and  last  of  the  creatures. According  to  God's  plan  of  successive  creation,  and  of  progressive advance in complexity and excellence of organization and endowment, man's true place is last in order as the immediate end and  crown  of  this  lower  creation.  The  scientific  advocates  of  the hypothesis  of  organic  development  have  denied  that  man  was created immediately by God, and have held that the higher and more complex living organisms were developed gradually and by successive  stages  from  the  lower  and  more  simple  as  the  physical condition of the world became gradually favorable to their existence, and that man at the proper time came last of all from the last link in</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the  order  of  being  immediately  below  him.  That  man,  on  the contrary,  was  immediately  created  by  God,  his  body  out  of  earthly materials previously created and his soul out of nothing, is rendered certain by the following evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  The hypothesis of development is a mere dream of unsanctified reason,  utterly  unsupported  by  facts.  Not  one  single  individual specimen of an organized being passing in transition from a lower species  to  a  higher  has  been  found  among  the  myriads  of  existing species, nor among the fossil remains of past species preserved in the record of the rocks.</li>
<li>(2)  The  Scriptures  expressly  affirm  the  fact  of  man's  immediate creation (Gen. 1:26,27; 2:7).</li>
<li>(3)  This  truth  is  rendered  obvious,  also,  by  the  immense  distance which separates man from the nearest of the lower animals; from the incomparable superiority of man in kind as well as degree; and from the  revealed  and  experienced  fact  that  "God  is  the  father  of  our spirits,"  and  that  we  are  immortal,  "joint  heirs  with  Christ"  (Heb. 12:9; Rom. 8:17).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God created one human pair, from whom the entire race in all its varieties has descended by generation, is a fundamental truth of the Christian revelation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One class of scientists, as Sir Charles Lyell, have concluded, from the positions  and  associations  in  which  human  remains  have  been found,  that  man  has  existed  upon  the  Earth  thousands  of  years before  Adam,  who  is  regarded  as  the  ancestor  only  of  a  particular variety  of  the  race.  All  this  weighs  nothing  against  the  positive teaching of the Scriptures, since the facts upon which the conclusion is based  are  not  all  certainly  substantiated,  and  have  not  been thoroughly  digested;  and  in  any  event  can  prove  nothing  as  to  the relation of Adam to the race, but only that he was created longer ago than we supposed.</p>
<p>Another class, of which the leader is Professor Agassiz, maintain that the differences between the different varieties of the human race are so great and so persistent that it is impossible that they could have been generated from the same parents, and that the progenitors of each  variety  were  created  separately,  each  in  their  appropriate geographical center. This conclusion of science may  be fairly balanced by the extreme opposite one above stated. If, in view of all the  facts  of  the  case,  it  is  possible  for  one  class  of  philosophers  to conclude that men, monkeys and dogs, etc., have descended, under the modifying influence of different conditions, from like progenitors,  surely  it  is  folly  for  another  class  to  affirm  that  it  is impossible that all the varieties of men have sprung from the same parents. That the doctrine of this section is true is proved:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The differences between the varieties of the human family are no greater  than  have  been  effected  by  differences  of  condition  and training among individuals of some of the lower orders of animals of known common descent.</li>
<li>(2)  The  human  family  form  one  and  not  different  species.  (a) Because  the  races  freely  intermix  and  produce  permanently  fertile offspring. (b) Because their mental, moral, and spiritual natures are identical.</li>
<li>(3) Archaeological,  historical, and  philological  investigations all indicate a common origin to all nations.</li>
<li>(4) The Scriptures directly assert this fact (Acts 17:26; Gen. 10). And the scriptural doctrines of original sin and of redemption presuppose it  as  a  fundamental  and  essential  condition  (1  Cor.  15:21,22;  Rom. 5:12-19).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God created man in his own image. This proposition includes the following elements: (1) Man was created like God, as to the physical constitution of his nature-a rational, moral, free, personal spirit. This fact is the essential condition upon which our ability to know God, as</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>well  as  our  capacity  to  be  subjects  of  moral  government,  depends. And in this respect the likeness is indestructible.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) He was created like God as to the perfection and integrity of his nature. This includes (a) Knowledge (Col. 3:10), or a capacity for the right  apprehension  of  spiritual  things.  This  is  restored  when  the sinner  is  regenerated,  in  the  grace  of  spiritual  illumination.  (b) Righteousness  and  true  holiness  (Eph.  4:24),  the  perfect  moral condition of the soul, and eminently of the character of the governing affections and will.</li>
<li>(3)  In  respect  to  the  dignity  and  authority  delegated  to  him  as  the head of this department of creation (Gen. 1:28).</li>
</ul>
<p>Pelagians have held that a created holiness is an absurdity; that, in order that a permanent disposition or habit of the soul should have a moral  character,  it  must  be  self-decided-i.e.,  formed  by  a  previous unbiased  choice  of  the  will  itself.  They  therefore  hold  that  God created  Adam  simply  a  moral  agent,  with  all  the  constitutional faculties prerequisite for moral action, and perfectly unbiased by any tendency of his nature either to good or evil, and left him to form his own  moral  character-to  determine  his  own  tendencies  by  his  own volition. But this view is not true, because-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) It is absurd. A state of moral indifference in an intelligent adult moral agent is an impossibility. Such indifference is itself sin. It is of the essence of moral good that it brings the will and all the affections of the soul under obligation.</li>
<li>(2)  If  God  did  not  endow  man  with  a  positive  moral  character,  he could  never  have  acquired  a  good  one.  The  goodness  of  a  volition arises wholly from the positive goodness of the disposition or motive which prompts it. But if Adam was created without a positive holy disposition  of  soul,  his  first  volition  must  have  either  been  sinful from  defect  of  inherent  goodness,  or  at  best  indifferent.  But  it  is evident  that  neither  a  sinful  nor  an  indifferent  volition  can  give  a</li>
</ul>
<p>holy  moral  character  to  whatever  dispositions  or  habits  may  be consequent upon it.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3)  The  Scriptures  teach  that  Adam  was  created  in  "righteousness and true holiness" (Eph. 4:24).</li>
<li>(a)  God  proclaimed  all  his  works  "very  good"  (Gen.  1:31).  But  the "goodness" of a moral agent essentially involves a holy character.</li>
<li>(b)  Eccl.  7:29:  "God  hath  made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions."</li>
<li>(c) In Gen. 1:27 it is declared that man was created in "the image of God." In Eph. 4:24 and Col. 3:10, men in regeneration are declared to be re-created in "the image  of God." Regeneration is the restoration of human  nature to its pristine condition, not a transmutation of that nature into a new form. The likeness to God which was lost by the fall must therefore be the same as that to which we are restored in the new birth. But the latter is said to consist in "knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness."</li>
<li>(4) Christ is the model  Man  (1 Cor. 15:45,47), produced by immediate divine power in the womb of the Virgin, not only without sin, but positively predetermined to holiness. In his mother's womb he was called "that holy thing" (Luke 1:35).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God should have furnished Adam with sufficient knowledge for  his  guidance is  necessarily implied in the feet that Adam was a holy  moral  agent  and  God  a  righteous  moral  governor.  Even  his corrupt and degenerate descendants are declared to have in the law written  upon  the  heart  a  light  sufficient  to  leave  them  "without excuse" (Rom. 1:20; 2:14,15). Adam, moreover, enjoyed special and direct  revelation  from  God,  and  was  particularly  directed  as  to  the divine will with respect to his use of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Adam, although created holy and capable of obedience, was at  the  same  time  capable of falling,  is  evident  from  the  event.  This appears to have been the moral condition in which both angels and men  were  created.  It  evidently  was  never  intended  to  be  the permanent condition of any creature.  It  is  one,  also,  of  the  special elements of which we can have no knowledge, either from experience or  observation.  God,  angels,  and  saints  in  glory  are  free,  but  with natures  certainly  and  infallibly  prompting  them  to  holiness.  Devils and fallen  men  are  free,  with  natures  infallibly  prompting  them  to evil. The  imperfectly  sanctified  Christian  is  the  subject  of  two conflicting inherent tendencies, the law in the members and the law of the Spirit; and his only security is that he is "kept by the power of God  through  faith  unto  salvation."  This  point  will  come  up  again under Chapter 6., Section 5.</p>

<p>SECTION 1:  GOD,  the  great  Creator  of  all  things,  doth  uphold,(1) direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things,(2) from the greatest even  to the least,(3) by his most  wise  and  holy providence,(4) according to his infallible foreknowledge,(5) and the free and immutable counsel of his own will,(6) to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy.(7)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Heb. 1:3. (2) Dan. 4:34,35; Ps. 135:6; Acts 17:25,26,28; Job 38:, 39:, 40:, 41: (3) Matt. 10:29-31. (4) Prov. 15:3; Ps. 104:24; 145:17. (5) Acts 15:18; Ps. 94:8-11. (6) Eph. 1:11; Ps. 33:10,11. (7) Isa. 63:14; Eph. 3:10; Rom. 9:17; Gen. 45:7; Ps. 145:7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since  the  eternal  and  immutable  purpose  of  God  has  certainly predetermined  whatsoever  comes  to  pass,  it  follows  that  he  must execute  his  own  purpose  not  only  in  his  works  of  creation,  but likewise  in  his  continual  control  of  all  his  creatures  and  all  their actions. This section therefore teaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  God  having  created  the  substances  of  which  all  things  are composed out of nothing, having endued these substances with their respective properties and powers, and having out of them formed all things organic and inorganic, and endowed them severally with their respective properties and faculties, he continues to sustain them in being and in the possession and exercise of those properties during the entire period of their existence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God directs all the actions of his creatures according to their respective properties and relations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  his  providential  control  extends  to  all  his  creatures  and  all their actions of every kind.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  his  providential  control  is  in  all  respects  the  consistent execution of his eternal, immutable, and sovereign purpose.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the final end of his providence is the manifestation of his own glory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>With  regard  to  the  question  how  God  is  concerned  in  upholding and  preserving  the  things  he  has  made,  three  different  classes  of opinion have prevailed:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  Deists  and  Rationalists  generally  regard  God  as  sustaining  no other relation to his works than that of the first of a series of causes and  effects. He  is supposed  to  touch  the  creation  only  at  its commencement, and having given to things a permanent independent  being  exterior  to himself, he leaves them  to the unmodified exercise of their own faculties.</li>
<li>(2) Pantheists regard all the phenomena of the universe of every kind as  merely  the  various  modes  of  one  universal  absolute  substance. The  substance  is  one,  the  modes  many;  the  substance  abides,  the modes rapidly succeed each other; the substance is God, the modes we call things. Some true Christian theologians have taken a view of the  relation  of  God  to  the  world  which  comes  perilously  near,  if  it does  not  coincide  with,  this  great  Pantheistic  heresy.  This  view  is, that God's power is constantly exerted in continually creating every individual  thing  again  and  again  every  fraction  of  duration;  that created things have no real being of their own, and exist only as thus they are each moment the product of creative energy; and hence that the  immediate  cause  of  the  state  or  action  of  any  creature  one moment of time is not its state or action the previous moment, but the direct act of divine creative power.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this be so, it is plain that God is the only real agent in the universe; that  he  is  the  immediate  cause  of  all  things,  including  all  evil passions  and  wicked  thoughts  and  acts;  that  consciousness  is  a thorough delusion, and the free agency and moral accountability of man vain imaginations.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) The third view is the true one, and it stands intermediate between the two above stated extremes. It may be stated as follows-</li>
<li>(a) God gave to all substances, both material and spiritual, a real and permanent existence as entities.</li>
<li>(b) They really possess all such active and passive properties as God has severally endued them with.</li>
<li>(c) These  properties  have  a  real  and  not  merely  an apparent efficiency as second causes in producing the effects proper to them.</li>
<li>(d) But these created substances, although possessing a real existence exterior to God, and exerting real efficiency as causes, are not self-existent; that is, the ground of their continued existence is in God and not in them. Though not to be confounded with God, they are  not  to  be  separated  from  him,  but  "in  him  live  and  move,  and have all their being."</li>
<li>(e) The precise nature of the exercise of divine energy whereby God interpenetrates  the  universe  with  his  presence,  embraces  it  and  all things  therein  in  his  power,  and  upholds  them  in  being,  is  not revealed, and of course is indiscoverable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That God always continues to exert his almighty power in upholding in  being  and  in  the  possession  and  use  of  their  endowments  all things he has made is proved-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) From the fact that continued dependence is inseparable from the idea  of  a  creature.  The  abiding  cause  of  the  creature's  continued existence must ever be in God, as it is not in itself.</li>
<li>(2) The relation of the creation to God cannot be analogous to that of a product of human skill to its maker. The one is exterior to his work. The intelligence and the power of the other is eternally omnipresent to every element of his work.</li>
<li>(3) A sense of absolute dependence for continued being, power, and blessedness, is involved in the religious consciousness of all men.</li>
<li>(4)  It  is  explicitly  taught  in  Scripture:  "By  him  all  things  consist" (Col. 1:17). "He upholdeth all things by the word of his power" (Heb. 1:3). "In him we live and move and have our being." (Acts 17:28). "O bless  our  God...which  holdeth  our  soul  in  life"  (Ps.  66:8,9;  63:8; 36:6).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God governs the actions of his creatures; and-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  his  government  extends  to  all  his  creatures  and  all  their actions, is proved-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) By  the  fact  that  the  religious  nature  of  man  demands  the recognition  of  this  truth.  It  is  involved  in  the  sense  of  dependence and  of  subjection  to  a  moral  government  which  is  involved  in  all religious feeling, and is recognized in all religions.</li>
<li>(2)  It  is  evidenced  in  the  indications  of  intelligence  everywhere present in the operations of external nature. The harmony, the due proportion, and the exquisite concurrence in action, which continue among  so  many  elements  throughout  ceaseless  changes,  prove beyond question  the  presence  of  an  intelligence  embracing  all  and directing each.</li>
<li>(3) The same is likewise indicated in the intelligent design evidently pursued in the developments of human history during long periods and throughout vast areas, and embracing myriads of agents. "That God is in history" is a conclusion of just science as well as a dictate of true religion.</li>
<li>(4) The Scriptures abound in prophecies fulfilled and unfulfilled, and promises and threatenings. Many of these are not mere enunciations of general  principles,  but  specific  declarations  of  purpose  with reference  to  his  treatment  of  individuals  conditioned  upon  their conduct.  The  fulfillment  of  these  could  not  be  left  to  the  ordinary course of nature, since there is often no natural connection between what is threatened or promised and the conditions on which they are suspended. God must therefore, by a constant providential regulation  of  the  system  of  things,  execute  his  own  word  to  his creatures.</li>
<li>(5) The Scriptures explicitly declare that such a providential control is exerted-(a) Over the physical world (i.) In general (Job 37:6-13; Ps. 104:14;  135:6,7;  147:15-18).  (ii.)  Individual  events  in  the  natural</li>
</ul>
<p>world, however trivial (Matt. 10:29). (b) Over fortuitous events (Job 5:6; Prov. 16:33). (c) Over the brute creation (Ps. 104:21-27; 147:9). (d)  Over  the  general  affairs  of  men  (Job  12:23;  Isa.  10:12-15;  Dan. 2:21; 4:25). (e) Over the circumstances of individuals (1 Sam. 2:6-8; Prov.  16:9;  James  4:13-15).  (f)  Over  the  free  actions  of  men  (Ex. 12:36; Ps. 33:14,15; Prov. 19:21; 21:1; Phil. 2:13). (g) Over the sinful actions of men (2 Sam. 16:10; Ps. 76:10; Acts 4:27,28). (h) Especially all that is good in man, in principle or action, is attributed to God's constant gracious control (Phil. 2:13; 4:13; 2 Cor. 12:9,10; Eph. 2:10; Ps. 119:36; Gal. 5:22,25).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the providential control of all things by God is the consistent execution in time of his eternal and immutable purpose is evident-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  From  the  statement  of  the  case.  Since  God's  eternal  purpose relates  to  and  determines  all  that  comes  to  pass,  and  since  it  is immutable, his providential control of all things must be in execution of  his  purpose.  And  since  his  purpose  is  infinitely  wise,  righteous, and  benevolent,  and  absolutely  sovereign  (as  shown  above),  his providential execution of the decree must possess the same characteristics.</li>
<li>(2)  The  same  is  explicitly  declared  in  Scripture:  "He  worketh  all things after the counsel of his own will." (Eph. 1:11; Isa. 28:29; Acts 15:18.)</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is evident that the chief design of God in his eternal purpose and in  his  works  of  creation  must  also  be  his  chief  end  in  all  his providential  dispensations.  This  has  been  shown  above  to  be  the manifestation of his own glory. It is also directly asserted as the final end of his providence. (Rom. 9:17; 11:36.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION  2:  ALTHOUGH  in  relation  to  the  foreknowledge  and decree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly;(8) yet, by the same providence, he orders them to fall out according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently.(9)</p>
<p>SECTION 3: GOD in his ordinary providence makes use of means, (10) yet is free to work without,(11) above,(12) and against them,(13) at his pleasure.</p>
<ul>
<li>(8) Acts 2:23. (9) Gen. 8:22; Jer. 31:35; Ex. 21:13; Deut. 19:5; 1 Kings 22:28,34; Isa. 10:6,7. (10) Acts 27:31,44; Isa. 55:10,11; Hos. 2:21,22. (11) Hos. 1:7; Matt. 4:4; Job 34:10. (12) Rom. 4:19-21. (13) 2 Kings 6:6; Dan. 3:27.</li>
</ul>
<p>These  sections  teach  the  doctrine  that  God's  purpose  is  efficacious and consistent, effected through means (secondary causes subject to His control), and that He possesses the power to effect His purpose directly and through His own energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  providential  control  which  God  exercises  over  all  his creatures and all their actions is always certainly efficacious, plainly follows (1) From his own infinite wisdom and power. (2) From the fact, before proved, that his eternal purpose determines the occurrence of all that comes to pass, and is immutable and certainly efficacious. (3) The fact is expressly declared in Scripture. (Job 23:13; Ps. 33:11; Lam. 2:17.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  manner  in  which  God  controls  his  creatures  and  their actions,  and  effects  his  purposes  through  them,  is  in  every  case perfectly consistent with the nature of the creature and of his mode of action, is certain-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  From the fact that God executes the different parts of the same eternal, self-consistent purpose, in his works of creation and providence. It is in the execution of the same unchangeable plan that God first created everything, endowed it with its properties, determined its mode of action and its mutual relations to all other things, and ever afterward continues to preserve it in the possession of its properties and to guide it in the exercise of them. As God must</li>
</ul>
<p>always be consistent to his own plan, so his mode of action upon the creatures whose existence and constitution have been determined by that plan must always be consistent with their natures and mode of action so determined.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) The  same  fact is proved by our uniform  experience  and observation. We are conscious of acting freely according to the law of our constitution as free agents. Even in the writings of the prophets and  apostles,  who  wrote  under  the  control  of  a  specific  divine influence, rendering even their selection of words infallibly accurate, we can plainly see that the spontaneous exercise of the faculties of the writers was neither superseded nor coerced. Every agent in the material  and  brute  creations,  also,  is  observed  constantly  to  act, under  all  changing  conditions,  according  to  the  uniform  law  of  its nature.</li>
<li>(3)  In  perfect  consistency  with  this,  we  see  everywhere  in  the material  world,  in  the  lives  of  individual  men,  and  in  all  human history, plain evidences of adjustments and combinations of elements and agents  in  the  order  of  contrivance  to  effect  purpose. This  in  principle  is  analogous  to,  though  in  many  ways  infinitely more  perfect  than,  the  methods  by  which  man  controls  natural agents to effect his purpose. If the laws of nature and the properties of  things,  when  imperfectly  understood,  can  be  brought  subject  to the  providence  of  man,  there  certainly  can  be  no  difficulty  in believing that they are infinitely more under the control of that God who not only understands them perfectly, but made them originally that  they  might  subserve  his  purpose.  It  is  just  the  perfection  of God's  adjustments  that  every  event,  as  well  as  general  results,  are determined by his intention. Even the human soul, in the exercise of free agency, acts according to a law of its own, excluding necessity, but not excluding certainty. The springs of free action are within the soul itself. And yet, as these are modified without interfering with the liberty  of  the  agent  by  the  influence  of  other  men,  they  certainly cannot lie beyond the control of the Infinite Intelligence who created</li>
</ul>
<p>the soul itself, and has determined all the conditions under which its character has been formed and its activities exercised.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  God  ordinarily  effects  his  purposes  through  means-that  is, through  the  agency  of  second  causes  subject  to  his  control-is  also evident-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1)  From  the  fact  that  he  originally  gave  them  their  being  and properties, and adjusted their relations in the execution of these very purposes. The same design is pursued in creation and in providence. The instruments furnished and the methods of procedure inaugurated in creation must, therefore, be consistently pursued in the subsequent dispensations of providence.</li>
<li>(2) Universal experience and observation teach us the same fact. In ordinary  providence  and  in  the  administration  of  a  supernatural economy of grace, in the sphere of material nature and in the moral government of intelligent and responsible agents, in the government of  the  finished  world  as  we  find  it  and  in  all  the  history  of  the formation of the Earth and the worlds in the past, God universally accomplishes  his  purposes  through  the  agency  of  second  causes, adjusted, combined, supported, and rendered efficient, by his omnipresent Spirit for this very end.</li>
<li>(3) A system involving an established order of nature, and proceeding  in  wise  adaptation  of  means  to  ends,  is  necessary  as  a means  of  communication  between  the  Creator  and  the  intelligent creation, and to accomplish the intellectual and moral education of the latter. Thus only can the divine attributes of wisdom, righteousness,  or  goodness,  be  exercised  or  manifested;  and  thus only can angel or man understand the character, anticipate the will, or intelligently and cooperate with the plan of God.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God possesses the power of effecting his ends immediately, without the intervention of second causes, is self-evident; and that he</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>at times at his sovereign pleasure exercises this power, is a matter of clear and satisfactory evidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Since God created all second causes and endowed them with their properties, and continues to uphold them in being, that they might be the instruments of his will, all their efficiency is derived from him, and he must be able to do directly without them what he does with them, and limit, modify, or supersede them, at his pleasure.</li>
<li>(2) The power of God does indeed work in all the ordinary processes of nature, and his will is expressed in what is called natural law; but it does  not  follow  that  his  whole  power  is  exhausted  in  those processes, nor his whole will expressed in those laws. God remains infinitely  greater  than  his  works,  in  the  execution  of  his  eternal, immutable  purposes,  using  the  system  of  second  causes  as  his constant  instrument  after  its  kind,  and  meanwhile  manifesting  his transcendent  prerogatives  and  powers  by  the  free  exercises  of  his energies and utterances of his will.</li>
<li>(3) Occasional direct exercises of God's power in connection with a general system of means and laws appear to be necessary, not only "in  the  beginning"  to  create  second  causes  and  inaugurate  their agency, but also subsequently in order to make to the subjects of his moral government the revelation of his free personality, and of his immediate interest in their affairs. At any rate such occasional direct action  and  revelation  are  certainly  necessary  for  the  education  of such beings as man is in his present estate. It has been objected that miracles, or direct acts of divine power, interfering with the natural action of second causes, are inconsistent with the infinite perfections of  God,  since  it  is  claimed  that  they  indicate  either  a  vacillation  of purpose upon his part, or some insufficiency in his creation to effect completely the ends he originally intended it to accomplish. It must be  remembered,  however,  that  the  eternal  and  immutable  plan  of God  comprehended  the  miracle  from  the  beginning  as  well  as  the ordinary  course  of  nature.  A  miracle,  although  effected  by  divine power without means, is itself a means to an end and part of a plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>All natural law has its birth in the divine reason, and is an expression of will to effect a purpose. In this highest, all-comprehensive sense of the word, miracles also are according to law-they are fixed in their occurrence by God's eternal plan, and they serve definite ends as his means of communicating with and educating finite spirits. They are in  no  proper  sense  a  violation  of  the  order  of  nature,  but  only  the occasional and eternally pre-calculated interpolation of a new power, the immediate energy of the divine will. The order of nature is only an instrument of the divine will, and an instrument used subserviently  to  that  higher  moral  government  in  the  interests  of which miracles are wrought. Thus the order of nature and miracles, instead of being in conflict, are the intimately correlated elements of one comprehensive system.</p>
<p>SECTION  4:  THE  almighty  power,  unsearchable  wisdom,  and infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his providence, that it extends itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men,(14) and that not by a bare permission,(15) but such as has joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding, (16)  and  otherwise  ordering  and  governing  of  them,  in  a  manifold dispensation,  to  his  own  holy  ends;(17)  yet  so  as  the  sinfulness thereof  proceeds  only  from  the  creature,  and  not  from  God;  who, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin.(18)</p>
<p>(14) Rom. 11:32-34; 2 Sam. 24:1; 1 Chron. 21:1; 1 Kings 22:22,23; 1 Chron. 10:4,13,14; 2 Sam.16:10; Acts. 2:23; 4:27,28. (15) Acts 14:16. (16)  Ps.  76:10;  2  Kings  19:28.  (17)  Gen.  50:20;  Isa.  10:6,7,12.  (18) James 1:13,14,17; 1 John 2:16.</p>
<p>This  section  makes  no  attempt  to  explain  the  nature  of  those providential actions of God which are concerned in the origin of sin in the moral universe, and in the control of the willful actions of his creatures  in  the  execution  of  his  purposes.  It  simply  states  the important facts with respect to the relation of his providence to the sins  of  his  creatures  which  are  revealed  in  Scripture.  These  points are--</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God not only permits sinful acts, but he directs and controls them to  the  determination  of  his  own  purposes.  Sinful  actions,  like  all others, are declared in Scripture to occur only by God's permission, and according to his purpose, so that what men wickedly do God is said to ordain (Gen. 14:4, 5; Ex. 7:13; 14:17; Acts 2:23; 3:18; 4:27,28). And he constantly restrains and controls men in their sins (Ps. 76:10; 2  Kings  19:28;  Isa.  10:15);  and  overrules  their  sins  for  good  (Acts 3:13; Gen. 50:20).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>2 Yet the sinfulness of these actions is only from the sinning agent, and  God  in  no  case  is  either  the  author  or  approver  of  sin.  The providence  of  God,  instead  of causing  sin or approving  it, is constantly concerned in forbidding it by positive law, in discouraging it  by  threatenings  and  actual  punishments,  in  restraining  it  and  in overruling it against its own nature to good.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 5: THE most wise, righteous, and gracious God, oftentimes leaves for a season his own  children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to make known them the hidden strength of corruption,  and  deceitfulness  of  their  hearts,  that  they  may  be humbled;(19)  and  to  raise  them  to  a  more  close  and  constant dependence for their support upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for various other just and holy ends. (20)</p>
<p>SECTION 6: AS for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God, as a righteous judge, for former sins, blinds and hardens,(21) from them he  not  only  withholds  his  grace,  whereby  they  might  have  been enlightened  in  their  understandings  and  wrought  upon  in  their hearts;(22) but sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had, (23)  and  exposes  them  to  such  objects  as  their  corruption  makes occasion of sin;(24) and withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan:(25) whereby it comes to pass, that they harden themselves, even under those means which God uses for the softening of others.(26)</p>
<p>SECTION 7: AS the providence of God does, in general, reach to all creatures;  so,  after  a  most  special  manner,  it  takes  care  of  his Church, and disposes all things to the good thereof.(27)</p>

</ul>
<p>We  have  seen  that  the  providential  government  of  God,  as  the execution through time of his eternal and immutable purpose, forms one  connected  system,  and  comprehends  all  created  things  and  all their actions. In perfect consistency with this, these sections proceed to teach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  general providence of God, embracing and dealing with every  creature  according  to  its  nature,  consequently,  although  one system, embraces several subordinate systems intimately related as parts  of  one  whole,  yet  also  distinct  in  their  respective  methods  of administration and in the immediate ends designed. The principal of these  are,  the  providence  of  God  over  the  material  universe;  the general moral government of God over the intelligent universe; the moral government of God over the human family in general in this world;  and  the  special  gracious  dispensation  of  God's  providence toward his Church.</li>

<li>These sections teach also that there is a relation of subordination subsisting between these several systems of providence, as means to ends  in  the  wider  system  which  comprehends  them  all.  Thus  the providential government of the material universe is subordinate as a</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>means to an end to the moral government which God exercises over his intelligent creatures, for whose  residence, instruction, and development,  the  physical  universe  was  created.  Thus  also  the providential government of God over mankind in general is subordinate as a means to an end to his gracious providence toward his Church, whereby he gathers it out of every people and nation, and makes  all  things  work  together  for  good  to  those  who  are  called according to his purpose (Rom. 8:28), and of course for the highest development and glory of the whole body. The history of redemption through  all  its  dispensations,  Patriarchal,  Abrahamic,  Mosaic,  and Christian, is the key to the philosophy of human history in general. The  race  is  preserved,  continents  and  islands  are  settled  with inhabitants,  nations  are  elevated  to  empire,  philosophy  and  the practical arts, civilization and liberty are advanced, that the Church, the Lamb's bride, may be perfected in all her members and adorned for her Husband.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  moral  government  of  God  over  all  men,  and  especially  his government of his Church includes also, besides an external providence  ordering  the  outward  circumstances  of  individuals,  an internal spiritual providence, consisting of the influences of his Spirit upon  their  hearts.  As  "common  grace,"  this  spiritual  influence extends to all men without exception, though in serious degrees of power,  restraining  the  corruption  of  their  nature,  and  impressing their hearts and consciences with the truths revealed in the light of nature  or  of  revelation;  and  it  is  either  exercised  or  judicially withheld  by  God  at  his  sovereign  pleasure.  As  "efficacious"  and "saving grace," this spiritual influence extends only to the elect, and is exerted upon them at such times and in such degrees as God has determined from the beginning.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence in the way of discipline for their own good, to mortify their sins and to strengthen their graces, God often wisely and graciously, though  never  finally,  for  a  season  and  to  a  degree,  withdraws  his spiritual influences from his own children, and "leaves them to the manifold temptations and corruptions of their own hearts."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence also God often, as a just punishment of their sins, judicially withdraws  the  restraints  of  his  Spirit,  and  consequently  whatever superficial gifts his presence may have conferred, from ungodly men, and thus leaves them to the influence of temptations, the unrestrained  control  of  their  lusts,  and  the  power  of  Satan.  And hence  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  truths  of  the  gospel  and  the ordinances of the Church, which are a savor of life to them to whom they are graciously blessed, become a savor of death and of increased condemnation  to them  who  for their sins have been left to themselves.</p>

<p>SECTION  1:  OUR  first  parents  being  seduced  by  the  subtlety  and temptation  of  Satan,  sinned  in  eating  the  forbidden  fruit.  (1)  This their sin God was pleased, according to his wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to his own glory. (2)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Gen. 3:13; 2 Cor. 11:3. (2) Rom. 11:32.</li>
</ul>
<p>God  having  brought  the  souls  of  Adam  and  Eve  into  being  by immediate creation holy, and with sufficient knowledge as to his will, capable of obedience yet fallible, this section proceeds to teach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Our first parents sinned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The particular sin they committed was their eating the forbidden fruit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It  appears  to  be  God's  general  plan,  and  one  eminently  wise  and righteous,  to  introduce  all  the  newly-created  subjects  of  moral government into a state of probation for a time, in which he makes their  permanent  character  and  destiny  depend  upon  their  own action. He creates them holy, yet capable of falling. In this state he subjects them to a moral test for a time. If they stand the test, the reward  is  that  their  moral  characters  are  confirmed  and  rendered infallible,  and  they  are  introduced  into  an  inalienable  blessedness forever. If they fail, they are judicially excluded from God's favor and communion  forever,  and  hence  morally  and  eternally  dead.  This certainly has been his method of dealing with newly-created angels and men. In the case of mankind the specific test to which our first parents were subjected was their abstaining from eating of the fruit of a single tree. As this was a matter in itself morally indifferent, it was admirably adapted to be a test of their implicit allegiance to God, of their absolute faith and submission.</p>
<p>The dreadful sin committed by Adam and Eve seems to hvae been twofold. Their unbelief induced them to doubt the wisdom of God's prohibition  and  the  certainty  of  the  divine  threatening;  and  their disobedience to God's will manifested their sin of unbelief. In respect to the origin of sin in this world, there are two questions which men constantly ask, and which it is impossible to answer:</p>
<p>A. How could sinful desires or volitions originate in the soul of moral agents  created  holy like Adam  and  Eve?  Men  exercise  choice according to their prevailing desires and affections. If these are holy, their  wills  are  holy.  And  the  character  of  their  prevailing  affections and desires is determined by the moral state of their souls. If their souls  are  holy,  these  are  holy;  if  their  souls  are  sinful,  these  are sinful.  Christ  says,  "A  good  man,  out  of  the  good  treasure  of  the heart,  bringeth  forth  good  things;  and  an  evil  man,  out  of  the  evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things." "Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt." (Matt. 12:33,35.) But Adam's heart had been created holy; how then could his action be sinful?</p>
<p>All our experience conspires to make the question more difficult. The sinful souls of fallen men never can give birth to holy volitions until they are regenerated by divine grace. The holy spirits of angels and glorified  men  in  heaven  are  forever  removed  from  all  liability  to sinful affections or actions. In both these cases the stream continues as the fountain.</p>
<p>Now, although we cannot explain precisely  the  origin  of  sin  in  the holy  soul  of  Adam,  it  is  plain  that  the  difficulty  lies  only  in  our ignorance. We have none of us experienced the same conditions of free  agency as those which give character to the case of Adam. We have always been under the bondage of corruption, except insofar as we are momentarily assisted  against  nature  by  supernatural  grace. Now,  in  order  that  a  volition  shall  be  holy,  it  must  spring  from  a positively holy affection or disposition; and as these are not native to our  hearts,  we  cannot  exercise  holy  volitions  without  grace.  But Adam was in a state of probation, holy yet fallible. Saints and angels are holy and infallible, yet their infallibility is not essential to their natures,  but  is  a  superadded  divine  grace  sustained  by  the  direct power of God. While holiness must always be positive, rooting itself in  divine  love,  it  is  plain  that  sin  may  originate  in  defect;  not  in positive  alienation,  but  in  want  of  watchfulness-in  the  temporary ascendancy  of  the  natural  and  innocent  appetites  of  the  body  or constitutional  tendencies  of  the  soul  over  the  higher  powers  of conscience.</p>
<p>The external influences and the subjective motives which prompted our  first  parents  to  this  dreadful  sin  did  not  in  the  first  instance imply  sin  in  them,  but  became  the  occasion  of  sin  upon  being allowed to occupy their minds and to sway their wills in despite of the divine prohibition. The external influences and motives combined  a  natural  appetite  for  the  attractive  fruit  with  a  natural desire  for  knowledge.  But  most  importantly,  they  were  seduced  by the temptation of Satan, about whose fall little is known, and unto whom the true origin of sin is to be referred.</p>
<ul>
<li>B.  The  other  element  of  mystery  with  regard  to  the  origin  of  sin relates to the permission of God. This section affirms, 4. That this sin was permissively embraced in the eternal purpose of God.</li>
</ul>
<p>About  the  facts  of  the  case  there  can  be  no  doubt.  (1)  God  did certainly  foreknow  that  if  such  a  being  as  Adam  was  put  in  such conditions as he was, he would sin as he sinned. Yet, in spite of this certain knowledge, God created that very being and put him in those very conditions; and having determined to overrule the sin for good, he sovereignly decreed not to intervene to prevent, and so he made it certainly  future.  (2)  On  the  other  hand,  God  did  neither  cause  nor approve  Adam's  sin.  He  forbade  it,  and  presented  motives  which should  have  deterred  from  it.  He  created  Adam  holy  and  fully capable of obedience, and with sufficient knowledge of his duty, and then left him alone to his trial. If it be asked why God, who abhors sin, and who benevolently desires the excellence and happiness of his creatures, should sovereignly determine to permit such a fountain of pollution,  degradation,  and  misery  to  be  opened,  we  can  only  say, with profound reverence, "Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God from the beginning designed to order the sin of Adam to his  own  glory  is  included  in  what  we  have  already  proved  in  the chapters on Creation and Providence-(1) That God overrules the sins of his creatures for good. (2) That the chief end of all God's purposes and works is the manifestation of his own glory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 2: BY this sin they fell from their original righteousness, and  communion  with  God,(3)  and  so  became  dead  in  sin,(4)  and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body.(5)</p>
<ul>
<li>(3)  Gen.  3:6-8;  Eccl.  7:29;  Rom.  3:23.  (4)  Gen.  2:17;  Eph.  2:1.  (5) Titus 1:15; Gen. 6:5; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 3:10-18.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally,  man  depends  upon  the  providential  sustaining  power  of God;  but  as  a  moral  and  religious  being  he  depends  upon  the intimate and loving communion of God's Spirit for spiritual life and right moral action. Therefore-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>By this sin man must have instantly been cut off from this loving communion  of  the  Divine  Spirit.  This  must  have  been  under  any constitution  the  natural  effect  of  sin.  And  under  that  covenant relation  into which  man  had  been  introduced  in  the  gracious providence of God at his creation,  it  was  specifically  provided  that the  commission of the forbidden act should be followed by instant death;  that  is,  instant  penal  exclusion  from  the  source  of  all  moral and spiritual life. See ch. 7., s. 2. Gen. 2:17. Therefore-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  principle  of  spiritual  life  having  been  withdrawn  as  the punishment of that first sin, our first parents must have instantly lost their original righteousness; their allegiance had been violated, their faith broken, and love could no longer dominate in their hearts. And thus-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>They must have at once become dead in sins and wholly corrupt. And 4. This corruption must have extended to all the faculties. It is not meant that Adam by this one sin became as bad as a man can be, or as he himself became afterward. But as death at the heart involves death in all the members, so the favor and communion of God being lost, (1) Original righteousness, the necessary principle of obedience, is  lost.  (2)  Adam's  apostasy  from  God  is  complete.  God  demands perfect  obedience,  and  Adam  is  now  a  rebel.  (3)  A  schism  was introduced  into  his  soul.  Conscience  uttered  its  condemning  voice. This  leads  to  fear,  distrust,  prevarication,  and  an  endless  series  of sins. (4) Thus his entire nature became depraved. The will being at war  with  the  conscience,  the  understanding  became  darkened,  the passions roused, the affections alienated, the conscience calloused or deceitful,  the  appetites  of  the  body  inordinate,  and  its  members instruments of unrighteousness.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 3: THEY being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was  imputed,(6)  and  the  same  death  in  sin  and  corrupted  nature conveyed  to  all  their  posterity,  descending  from  them  by  ordinary generations.(7)</p>
<p>SECTION 4: FROM this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good,(8) and wholly inclined to all evil,(9) do proceed all actual transgressions.(10)</p>
<ul>
<li>(6)  Gen.  1:27,28;  2:16,17;  Acts  17:26;  Rom.  5:12,  15-19;  1  Cor. 15:21,22,45,49. (7) Ps. 51:5; Gen. 5:3; Job 14:4; 15:14. (8) Rom. 5:6; 8:7;  7:18;  Col.  1:21.  (9)  Gen.  6:5;  8:21;  Rom.  3:10-12.  (10)  James 1:14,15; Eph. 2:2,3; Matt. 15:19.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Adam was both the natural and federal head of all mankind, Christ of course excepted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  nature  and  provisions  of  that  covenant  which  God  made  with Adam will  be  considered  in  its  appropriate  place,  ch.  8:,  s.  2.  The point  which  demands  our  attention  here  is,  that  in  making  that covenant with Adam, God constituted him and treated with him as the moral representative of all his natural descendants. This is very explicitly taught in our Standards. Conf. Faith, ch. 7:, s. 2: "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised  to  Adam,  and  in  him  to  his  posterity,  upon  condition  of perfect and personal obedience." L. Cat., q. 22: "The covenant being made with Adam as a public person, not for himself only, but for his posterity, all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him, in his first transgression." S. Cat., q. 16: "The covenant being made with Adam, not only for himself, but for  his  posterity,  all  mankind,  descending  from  him  by  ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him, in his first transgression."</p>
<p>As we have seen, it is God's general method of dealing with newlycreated moral agents to create them holy, yet capable of falling, and then  to  put  them  on  trial  for  a  time,  making  their  confirmed  and permanent moral character and destiny to depend upon their own action. In the case of the angels, who  were  severally  created independent  individuals,  they  appear to have  stood  their trial severally, each  in his own  person.  Some  fell,  and some  were confirmed in holiness and blessedness. But in the case of a race to be propagated  in  a  series,  each  individual  to  come  into  existence  an unintelligent infant, thence to develop gradually into moral agency, like  that  of  mankind,  it  is  obvious  that  one  of  three  plans  must  be adopted:  (1)  The  whole  race  must  be  confirmed  in  holiness  and happiness without any probation. (2) Each individual must stand his own probation while groping his way from infancy into childhood. (3) Or the whole race must have their trial in their natural head and root, Adam. We are not in a condition to judge of the propriety of the first of these plans, but we  can easily see that the third is incomparably  more  rational, righteous, and merciful than the second.</p>
<p>As  a  matter  of  fact,  God  did  make  our  character  and  destiny  to depend upon the conduct of Adam in his probation. This was right(1) Because, as sovereign Creator, and infinitely wise, righteous, and merciful Guardian of the interests of all his creatures, it seemed right in his eyes. (2) Because it was more to our advantage than any other plan that can be imagined. Adam was most advantageously constituted and circumstanced in order that he should stand the trial safely. Incalculable benefits as well as risks were suspended upon his action. If he had maintained his integrity for a limited period, all his race would have been born into an indefeasible inheritance of glory. (3)  Because  the  covenant  headship  of  Adam  is  part  of  a  glorious constitution  which  culminates  in  the  covenant  headship  of  Christ. That Adam was, as our Standards say, "a public person," and that the covenant  was  made  with  him  "not  for  himself  only,  but  for  his posterity," is proved from the facts-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) That he was called by a generic name, Adam-the Man.</li>
<li>(2) That everything that God commanded, promised, or threatened him  related  to  his  descendants  as  much  as  to  himself  personally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,  "obedience,"  "a  cursed  earth,"  "the  reign  of  death,"  "painful child-bearing," and the subsequent promise of redemption through the Seed of the woman, were spoken with reference to us as much as with reference to our first parents.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3)  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  very  penalty  denounced  and  executed upon Adam has been executed upon all of his descendants from birth upward. All are born spiritually dead, "by nature children of wrath." Also, from the fact that-</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  guilt  of  that  sin  is  imputed  to  all  his  descendants,  and  the penalty executed upon them at their birth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By  the  word  "guilt"  is  meant,  not  the  personal  disposition  which prompted the act, nor the personal moral pollution which resulted from it, but simply the just liability to the punishment which that sin deserved.</p>
<p>By the term "impute" is meant to lay to the charge or credit of any one as a ground of judicial punishment or justification. This is the sense in which the phrase "to impute sin" or "righteousness" is used in  the  Bible.  "David  describeth  the  blessedness  of  the  man  unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, . . . to whom the Lord  will  not  impute  sin.  .  .  .  Faith  was  imputed  to  Abraham  for righteousness."  (Rom.  4:3-9.)  "God  was  in  Christ,  reconciling  the world  unto  himself,  not  imputing  their  trespasses  unto  them."  (2 Cor. 5:19.)</p>
<p>Our Standards expressly affirm that the "guilt," or just liability to the penalty, of Adam's apostatizing act is by God "imputed," or judicially laid to the charge of each of his natural descendants. Conf. Faith, ch. 6., s. 3: "This sin was imputed . . . to all their posterity." In L. q. 25, and S.  Cat.,  q.  18,  "the  sinfulness  of  that  estate  into  which  the  fall brought  mankind"  is  declared  to  include  each  of  the  following elements:</p>
<p>"(1) The guilt of Adam's first sin; (2) The want of original righteousness;  (3)  The  corruption  of  his  whole  nature,  which  is commonly called original sin; together with all actual transgressions which proceed from it." The reason which our Standards give for this judicial  charging  the  punishableness  of  Adam's  first  sin  to  all  his posterity is, that they really "sinned in him in his first transgression" (L. Cat., q. 22; S. Cat., q. 16); since he acted as "a public person," and the covenant was made with him "not for himself only, but for his posterity" (L. Cat., q. 22; S. Cat., q. 16). That is, Adam, by a divine constitution, so represented and acted for all his posterity that they are fairly responsible for his action, and are worthy of punishment on account of it. Since their destiny, as well as his own, was suspended upon Adam's action, since they were justly to have part in his reward if he was faithful, so they justly have part in his punishment for his unfaithfulness.</p>
<p>The  Articles  of  the  Synod  of  Dort  affirm  that  moral  depravity  is inflicted  upon  all  the  descendants  of  Adam  at  birth  "by  the  just judgment  of  God."  Ch.  3.,  s.  2.  This  is  also  explicitly  taught  in Scripture. Paul teaches, in Rom. 5:12-21, (1) That the law of death, spiritual and physical, under which we are born, is a consequent of Adam's  public  disobedience;  and  (2)  That  it  is  a  "judgment,"  a "condemnation"-that is, a penal consequent of Adam's sin: "Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation." (3) That the punishment of Adam's sin comes upon us upon the same principle upon which the righteousness of Christ is charged to the account of those who believe on him: "Therefore as by the  offence  of  one  judgment  came  upon  all  men  to  condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life." But the righteousness of Christ is imputed without works (Rom. 4:6), before, and as the necessary condition of, good dispositions or actions upon our part. So the guilt of Adam's sin is  imputed  to  his  posterity  without  personal  works  of  their  own, before, and as the cause of, their loss of original righteousness and acquisition of original sin. The  only Sin of Adam  which  the Confession says was "imputed" to his descendants, and the Sin of his which they assert we "sinned in him," was his first sin or apostatizing act. The manifest reason of this is that he represented us, and we are responsible  for  him  only  in  his  trial  for  character  and  destiny.  His first sin, by incurring the penalty, necessarily and instantly closed his probation and ours, and he immediately became a private person.</p>
<p>The penalty denounced upon Adam and those whom he represented in his trial was the judicial withdrawment of the life-giving influences of the Holy Ghost, and the inevitable consequent moral and physical death. Hence every newly-created soul comes into existence judicially excluded from the life-giving influences of the Holy Spirit, and  hence  morally  and  spiritually  dead.  Other  actual  sins  and miseries  in  time  occur  as  the  natural  consequence  of  this  birthpunishment.  But  the  Scriptures  and  our  own  consciousness  also affirm  that  these  actual  transgressions  are  our  own  personal  sins, and that all the temporal and eternal punishments we suffer are on account of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It hence follows, that if the guilt of Adam's apostasy is charged to all his natural descendants, and  the Holy  Spirit consequently judicially  withdrawn  from  them  at  their  birth,  the  same  moral corruption which ensued from the same cause in the case of our first parents must, from their birth, follow in their descendants also. Of this "corrupted nature" this section proceeds to say-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That by it "we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil"; and,-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>"From  this  original  corruption"  of  nature  "proceed  all  actual transgressions."  It  is  here  taught  (1)  That  all  men  sin  from  the commencement of moral agency. (2) That back of this their nature is morally corrupt, indisposed to all good, and inclined to all evil. (3) That this moral corruption is so radical and inveterate that men are by nature "disabled" with respect to right moral action. (4) That this condition  is  innate  from  birth  and  by  nature  this  representation agrees with universal experience. All the children of men, of all ages,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>nations, and circumstances, and how ever educated, invariably sin as soon as they become capable of moral action. A universal fact must have  a  cause  universally  present.  This  can  only  be  found  in  the common depravity of our nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) With all the teachings of Scripture. (a) It declares that all men are sinners. (Rom. 1, 2, and 3:1-19.) (b) That sinful actions proceed from sinful  hearts  or  dispositions.  (Matt.  15:19;  Luke  6:43-45.)  (c)  That the  disposition  which  prompts  to  sinful  action  is  "sin,"  a  moral corruption. (Rom. 6:12,14,17; 7:5-17; Gal. 5:17,24; Eph. 4:18,19.)</li>
<li>(d)  That  this  corruption  involves  moral  and  spiritual  blindness  of mind, as well as hardness of heart and vile affections. (1 Cor. 2:14,15; Eph. 4:18.) (e) That this moral corruption and prevailing tendency to sin is in our nature from birth. (Ps. 51:5; Eph. 2:3; John 3:6.) (f) That men in their  natural  state  are  "dead"  in  trespasses  and  sins.  (Eph. 2:1; John 3:4,5.) And (g) That consequently they can be restored by no "change of purpose" nor "moral reformation" upon their part, but only  by  an  act  of  almighty  power  called  "a  new  birth"  "a  new creation,"  "a  begetting,"  "a  quickening  from  the  dead."  (Eph.  4:24, 2:5,10; John 3:3; 1 John 5:18.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Confession teaches of man's sinful inability to do right, in consequence of the depravity of his nature, will be considered under its appropriate head, in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>SECTION 5: THIS corruption of nature, during this life, remain in those  that  are  regenerated;(11)  and  although  it  be  through  Christ pardoned and mortified, yet both itself, and all the motions thereof, are truly and properly sin.(12)</p>
<p>SECTION 6: EVERY  sin, both original and actual. being a transgression  of  the  righteous  law  of  God,  and  contrary  thereunto, (13) doth, in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner,(14) whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God,(15) and curse of the law,(16)</p>
<p>and  so  made  subject  to  death,(17)  with  all  miseries  spiritual,(18) temporal,(19) and eternal.(20)</p>
<ul>
<li>(11) 1 John 1:8,10; Rom. 7:14,17,18,23; James 3:2; Prov. 20:9; Eccl. 7:20. (12) Rom. 7:5,7,8, 25; Gal. 5:17. (13) 1 John 3:4. (14) Rom. 2:15; 3:9,19. (15) Eph. 2:3. (16) Gal. 3:10. (17) Rom. 6:23. (18) Eph. 4:18. (19) Rom. 8:20; Lam. 3:39. (20) Matt. 25:41; 2 Thess. 1:9.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sections speak of the corruption that remains in the regenerated,  and  of  the  guilt  or  just  liability  to  punishment  which attaches to all sin, and of the punishments God inflicts upon it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I. Of the first, it is taught-</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Original sin, or innate moral corruption, remains in the regenerate as long as they live.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is pardoned through the merits of Christ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it  is  gradually  brought into subjection and mortified by the work of the Holy Spirit in sanctification.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  nevertheless  all  that  remains  of  it,  and  all  the  feelings  and actions to which it prompts, are truly of the nature of sin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of  these  points  will  be  more  appropriately  treated  under  the heads  of  Justification,  Conf.  Faith,  ch.  11.;  and  of  Sanctification, Conf. Faith, ch. 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>II. Of the second, it is taught-</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Original sin-that is, the nature corrupt tendencies and affections of the soul- is truly a violation of God's law as actual transgression.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Catechisms. (L. Cat., q. 24; S. Cat., q. 14) define sin to be "any want of conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God."</p>
<p>This corresponds exactly with what the apostle teaches (1 John 3:4): "Sin is anouia "-any discrepancy of the creature or his acts with God's law. This is evident-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Because  from  its  very  essence  the  moral  law  demands  absolute perfection of character and disposition as well as action. Whatever is right is essentially obligatory; whatever is wrong is essentially worthy of condemnation. God requires us to be holy as well as to act rightly. God proclaims himself as "he which searcheth the reins and hearts." (Rev. 2:23.)</li>
<li>(2)  The  native  corrupt  tendencies  which  constitute  original  sin  are called  sin  in  Scripture.  Sin  and  its  lusts  are  said  to  "reign"  in  our mortal bodies; sin is said to have "dominion"; the unregenerate are called "the servants of sin." (Rom. 6:12-17; 7:5-17; Gal. 5:17,24; Eph. 4:18,19.)</li>
<li>(3)  God  condemns  men  for  their  corrupt  natural  dispositions,  for their  hardness  of  heart,  spiritual  blindness  of  mind.  (Mark  16:14; Eph. 2:3.)</li>
<li>(4) In all genuine conviction of sin, the great burden of pollution and guilt is felt to consist not in what we have done, but in what we areour permanent moral condition rather than our actual transgressions.  The  great  cry  is  to  be  forgiven  and  delivered  from "the wicked heart of unbelief," "deadness to divine things, alienation from God as a permanent habit of soul." "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (Rom. 7:24; Ps. 51:5,6.)</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It  hence  necessarily  follows  that  original  sin,  as  well  as  actual transgressions,  deserves  the  curse  of  the  law.  Everything  which  is condemned by the law is under its curse. This is evident From what we learned of the justice of God in ch. 2., ss. 1, 2. (2) From the fact that  it  is  the  universal  judgment  of  men  that  sin  is  intrinsically  illdesert-that all that ought not to be is worthy of condemnation. (3)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the fact that the Holy Ghost, in convincing men of sin, always likewise convinces them of a judgment. (John 16:8.) (4) Men are "by nature children of wrath." Eph. 2:3. (5) Even infants are redeemed by Christ. And in their case, as in all others, he redeemed them from the curse of the law, being made a curse for them. (Gal. 3:13.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Consequently, the sinner guilty of original and of actual transgressions  is,  unless  grace  intervene,  made  subject  to  death, including temporal, spiritual, and eternal miseries.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The temporal miseries indicted upon men, in the just displeasure of God for their sin, are summarily set forth in the Larger Catechism, q. 28,  as  "the  curse  of  God  upon  the  creatures  for  our  sakes,  and  all other evils that befall us in our bodies, names, estates, relations, and employments;  together  with  death  itself."  This,  of  course,  applies only to the still unbelieving, unjustified sinner; for all the tribulations which are suffered by the justified believer in this life are chastisements, designed for his benefit, and  expressive of his heavenly  Father's  love-not  penal  evils,  expressive  of  his  wrath  and unsatisfied justice.</p>
<p>The spiritual miseries which sin brings upon the unforgiven in this life  are  set  forth  "as  blindness  of  mind,  a  reprobate  sense,  strong delusions, hardness of heart, horror of conscience, and vile affections."  )Eph.  4:18;  Rom.  1:28;  2  Thess.  2:11;  Rom.  2:5;  Isa. 33:14; Gen. 4:13; Matt. 27:4; Rom. 1:26; L. Cat., q. 28.)</p>
<p>The eternal miseries which are consequent upon unforgiven sin are set forth as "everlasting separation from the comfortable presence of God, and most  grievous torments in soul and body, without intermission, in hell-fire forever." (2 Thess. 1:9; Mark 9:43,44,46,48; Luke 16:24.)</p>

<h2 id="chapter-seven-of-gods-covenant-with-man">Chapter Seven Of God's Covenant With Man<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-seven-of-gods-covenant-with-man" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SECTION 1: THE distance between God and the creature is so great, that  although  reasonable  creatures  do  owe  obedience  unto  him  as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness  and  reward,  but  by  some  voluntary  condescension  on God's part, which he has been pleased to express by way of covenant. (1)</p>
<p>SECTION 2-THE first covenant made with man was a covenant of works,(2)  wherein  life  was  promised  to  Adam,  and  in  him  to  his posterity,(3) upon condition of perfect and personal obedience.(4)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Isa. 40:13-17; Job 9:32,33; 1 Sam. 2:25; Ps. 113:5,6; 100:2,3; Job 22:  2,3;  35:7,8;  Luke  17:10;  Acts  17:24,25.  (2)  Gal.  2:12.  (3)  Rom. 10:5; 5:12-20. (4) Gen. 2:17; Gal. 3:10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here  we  come  to  the  duty  which  an  intelligent  creature  owes  its Creator,  that  it  is  essential  and  inalienable  of  the  creature's  being. Moreover, the enjoyment of the creator by the creature is wholly a matter of sovereign grace, manifest to man through the conditional promises  (covenants)  of  God-the  first  of  which  concerned  Adam, wherein  the  promise  was  life  and  the  condition  perfect,  personal obedience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  duty  which  an  intelligent  creature  owes  to  its  Creator  is inalienable, and springs necessarily,-(1) From the absolute, imperative  obligation  which  is  of  the  essence  of  all  that  is  morally right-which  exercises  authority  over  the  will,  but  does  not  receive authority  from  it;  and  (2)  From  the  relation  of  dependence  and obligation involved in the very fact of being created. To be a created, intelligent, moral agent, is to be under all the obligation of obeying the  will  and  of  living  for  the  glory  of  the  absolute  Owner  and Governor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The very act of creation brings the creature under obligation to the Creator,  but  it  cannot  bring  the  Creator  into  obligation  to  the creature.  Creation  itself,  being  a  signal  act  of  grace,  cannot  endow the beneficiary with a claim for more grace. If God, for instance, has created a man with an eye, it may be eminently consistent with the divine attributes, and a ground of fair anticipation, that at some time he who has given eyes will also give light; but, surely, the creation of the first can lay the foundation of no right upon the part of man for the  gift  of  the  second.  And,  of  course,  far  less  can  the  fact  that  in creation God endowed men with a religious nature lay the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>foundation of any right on their part for the infinitely more precious gift  of  the  personal  communications  of  his  own  ineffable  love  and grace. God cannot be bound to take all creatures naturally capable of it into the intimacies of his own society. If he does so, it is a matter of infinite condescension and sovereign will.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the case of men and angels, God has been pleased to promise this transcendent benefit upon certain conditions; which conditional promise  is  called  a  covenant.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  this amazing gift of God's personal love and life-giving society had been offered to angels, and at the beginning was offered to the first human pair,  upon  conditions.  Some  object  that  the  conditional  promise made to Adam in the garden is not explicitly called a covenant, and that it does not possess all the essential elements of a covenant, since it  was  a  constitution  sovereignly  ordained  by  the  Creator  without consulting the will of the creature. It is a sufficient answer to these objections-(1) That although Adam's will was not consulted, yet his will was unquestionably cordially consenting to this divine constitution and all the terms thereof, and hence the transaction did embrace  all  the  elements  of  a  covenant.  (2)  That  instances  of analogous  transactions  between  God  and  men  are  expressly  styled covenants in the Bible. If God's transactions with Noah (Gen. 9:11,12) and  with  Abraham  (Gen.  17:1-21)  were  covenants,  then  was  his transaction with Adam in the garden a covenant.</li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis of a covenant always gives the following elements: (a) Its parties. (b) Its promise. (c) Its conditions. (d) Its penalty. As to its parties, our Standards teach-</p>
<p>In the first covenant that concerned mankind God dealt with Adam as  the  representative  of  all  his  descendants.  The  parties,  therefore, are  God  and  Adam,  the  latter  representing  the  human  race.  That Adam did so act as the representative of his descendants, in such a sense that they were equally interested with himself in all the merit or  the  demerit,  the  reward  or  the  penalty,  attaching  to  his  action during  the  period  of  probation,  has  already  been  proved  to  be  the doctrine both of our Standards and of Scripture. (Ch. 6., ss. 3, 4.) As to  the  further  nature  of  this  covenant,  our  Standards  teach-The promise of it was life, the condition of it perfect obedience, and the penalty of it death. (L. Cat., q. 20; S. Cat., q. 12.)</p>
<p>This covenant is variously styled, from one or other of these several elements. Thus, it is called the "covenant of works," because perfect obedience was its condition, and to distinguish it from the covenant of grace, which rests our salvation on a different basis altogether. It is  also  called  the  "covenant  of  life,"  because  life  was  promised  on condition  of  the  obedience.  It  is  also  called  a  "legal  covenant," because it demanded the literal fulfillment of the claims of the moral law  as  the  condition  of  God's  favor.  This  covenant  was  also  in  its essence a covenant of grace, in that it graciously promised life in the society of God as the freely-granted reward of an obedience already unconditionally due. Nevertheless it was a covenant of works and of law with respect to its demands and conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) That the promise of the covenant was life is proved-(a) From the nature of the penalty, which is recorded in terms. If disobedience was linked  to  death,  obedience  must  have  been  linked  to  life.  (b)  It  is taught expressly in many passages of Scripture. Paul says, Rom. 10:5, "Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which  does  those  things  shall  live  by  them."  (Matt.  19:16,17;  Gal. 3:12; Lev. 18:5; Neh. 9:29.)</li>
</ul>
<p>That  the  life  promised  was  not  mere  continuance  of  existence  is plain-(a) From the fact that the death threatened was not the mere extinction of existence. Adam experienced that death the very day he ate the forbidden fruit. The death threatened was exclusion from the communion of God. The life promised, therefore, must consist in the divine fellowship and the excellence and happiness thence resulting. (b) From the fact that mere existence was not in jeopardy. It is the character, not the fact, of continued existence which God suspended upon obedience. (c) Because the terms "life" and "death" are used in the Scriptures constantly to define two opposite spiritual conditions, which depend upon the relation of the soul to God. (John 5:24; 6:4; Rom. 6:23; 11:15; Eph. 2:1-3; 5:14; Rev. 3:1.)</p>
<p>(2) That the condition of the covenant was perfect obedience is plain from the fact-(a) That the divine law can demand no less. It is of the essence  of  all  that  is  right  that  it  is  obligatory.  James  says,  that "whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is  guilty  of  all."  James  2:10;  Gal.  3:10;  Deut.  27:26.  (b)  That  the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, relating to a thing indifferent in itself, was plainly designed to be a naked test of obedience, absolute and without limit.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) That the penalty of this covenant was death is distinctly stated: "In the day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die." Gen. 3:17. This denoted  a  most  lamentable  state  of  existence,  physical  and  moral, and  not  the  cessation  of  existence  or  the  dissolution  of  the  union between soul and body, because-(a) It took effect in our first parents hundreds of years before the dissolution of that union. (b) Because the Scriptures constantly describe the moral and spiritual condition into  which  their  descendants  are  born,  and  from  which  they  are delivered by Christ, as a state of death. (Rev. 3:1; Eph. 2:1-5; 5:14; John 5:24.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This death is a condition of increasing sin and misery, resulting from excision  from  the  only  source  of  life.  It  involves  the  entire  person, soul and body, and continues as long as the cause continues.</p>
<p>SECTION 3: MAN by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second,(5) commonly called  the  covenant  of  grace:  whereby  he  freely  offers  unto  sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved;(6) and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe.(7)</p>
<p>SECTION 4: THIS covenant  of  grace  is  frequently  set  forth  in  the Scripture  by  the  name  of  a  testament,  in  reference  to  the  death  of Jesus Christ the testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.(8)</p>
<p>(5)  Gal.  3:21;  Rom.  8:3;  3:20,21;  Gen.  3:15;  Isa.  42:6.  (6)  Mark 16:15,16; John 3:16; Rom. 10:6,9; Gal. 3:11. (7) Ezek. 36:26,27; John 6:44,45. (8) Heb. 9:15-17; 7:22; Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25.</p>
<p>Since  Adam  forfeited  for  himself  and  his  entire  race  the  original promise of life upon the condition of perfect obedience, and incurred the penalty of death attached to disobedience, it follows that, if the old  constitution  is  left  without  supplement  or  modification,  man  is lost.  If  mankind  is  to  be  saved,  there  must  be  a  new  and  gracious intervention on the part of God. And if God intervenes to save men, it must be upon a definite plan, and upon certain definitely proclaimed and accurately fulfilled conditions. That is, a new covenant must be introduced, rendering life attainable to those who are to be saved on conditions different from those offered in the preceding constitution. The question, then, relates to what is revealed in the Scriptures as to the parties to whom the promise is made, and the conditions upon which it is suspended.</p>
<p>The  Arminian  view  is,  that  Adam  having  lost  the  promise  and incurred  the  penalty  of the covenant  which  demanded  perfect obedience, Christ's death having made it consistent with the claims of absolute justice, God for Christ's sake introduces a new covenant, styled  the  covenant  of  grace,  offering  to  all  men  individually  the eternal life forfeited by Adam on the lowered and graciously possible condition of faith and evangelical obedience. According to this view, the new covenant is just as much a covenant of works as the old one was;  the  only  difference  is  that  the  works  demanded  are  far  less difficult, and we are graciously aided in our endeavors to accomplish them. According to this view, also,  faith  and  evangelical  obedience secure eternal life in the new covenant in the same way that perfect obedience did in the old covenant.</p>
<p>This view is plainly inconsistent with the nature of the gospel. The method  of  salvation  presented  in  the  gospel  is  no  compromise  of principle, no lowering of terms. Christ fulfills the old legal covenant absolutely;  and  then,  on  the  foundation  of  what  he  has  done,  we exercise faith or trust, and through that trust we are made sharers in his righteousness and beneficiaries of his grace. Faith is not a work which Christ condescends in the gospel to accept instead of perfect obedience as the ground of salvation-it is only the hand whereby we clasp the person and work of our Redeemer, which is the true ground of salvation.</p>
<p>The Calvinist view, therefore, is, that God having determined to save the  elect  out  of  the  mass  of  the  race  fallen  in  Adam,  appointed his Son to become incarnate in our nature; and as the Christ, or Godman  Mediator,  he  appointed  him  to  be  the  second  Adam  and representative head of redeemed humanity; and as such entered into a covenant with him and with his seed in him. In this covenant the Mediator assumes in behalf of his elect seed the broken conditions of the  old  covenant  of  works  precisely  as  Adam  left  them.  Adam  had failed  to  obey,  and  therefore  forfeited  life;  he  had  sinned,  and therefore  incurred  the  endless  penalty  of  death.  Christ  therefore suffered  the  penalty,  and  extinguished  in  behalf  of  all  whom  he represented the claims of the old covenant; and at the same time he rendered a perfect vicarious obedience, which was the very condition upon  which  eternal  life  had  been  originally  offered.  All  this  Christ does as a principal party with God to the covenant, in acting as the representative of his own people.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in the administration and gracious application of this covenant, Christ the Mediator offers the blessings secured by it to all men on the condition of faith-that is, he bids all men to lay hold of these blessings by the instrumentality of faith, and he promises that if they  do  so  they  shall  certainly  enjoy  them;  and  he,  as  the mediatorial Surety of his people, insures for them that their faith and obedience shall not fail.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, some Calvinist theologians have set forth the divine method  of  human  redemption  as  embraced  in  two covenants The first, styled the "covenant of redemption," formed in eternity between the Father and Christ as principal, providing for the salvation  of  the  elect;  the  second,  styled  the  "covenant  of  grace," wherein  life  is  offered  to  all  men  on  the  condition  of  faith,  and secured to the elect through the agency of Him who, as "surety of the new covenant," insures the fulfillment of the condition in their case.</p>
<p>Our Standards say nothing of two covenants. They do not mention the covenant of redemption as distinct from the covenant of grace. But evidently the several passages which treat of this subject (Conf. Faith, ch. 7., s. 3; L. Cat., q. 31; S. Cat., q. 20) assume that there is but one covenant, contracted by Christ in behalf of the elect with God in eternity,  and  administered  by  him  to  the  elect  in  the  offers  and ordinances of the gospel and in the gracious influences of his Spirit. The  Larger  Catechism  in  the  place  referred  to  teaches  how  the covenant  of  grace  was  contracted  with  Christ  for  his  people.  The Confession of Faith in these sections teaches how that same covenant is administered by Christ to his people.</p>
<p>The doctrine of our Standards and of Scripture may be stated in the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>At the basis of human redemption there is an eternal covenant or personal counsel between the Father, representing the entire Godhead,  and  the  Son,  who  is  to  assume  in  the  fullness  of  time  a human element into his person, and to represent all his elect as their Mediator  and  Surety.  The  Scriptures  make  it  very  plain  that  the Father and the Son had a definite understanding (a) as to who were to be saved, (b) as to what Christ must do in order to save them, (c) as to how their personal salvation was to be accomplished, (d) as to all the blessings and advantages involved in their salvation, and (e) as to certain official rewards which were to accrue to the Mediator in consequence of his obedience.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) The Scriptures expressly declare that the Father has promised the Mediator the salvation of his seed on condition of "the travail of his soul." (Isa. 53:10,11; 13:6,7; Ps. 89:3, 4.)</li>
<li>(2) Christ makes constant reference to a previous commission he had received of his Father (John 10:18; Luke 22:29), and claims a reward conditioned upon the fulfillment of that commission. (John 17:4, 5.)</li>
<li>(3)  Christ  as  Mediator  constantly  asserts  that  his  people  and  his expected  glory  are  given  him  as  a  reward  by  his  Father.  (John 17:2,24.)</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  promise  of  this  covenant  was-(1)  All  needful  preparation  of Christ for his work. (Heb. 10:5; Isa. 13:1-7.) (2) Support in his work. (Luke  22:43.)  (3)  A  glorious  reward  (a)  In  his  own  Theanthropic person as Mediator. (John 5:22; Ps. 110:1.) (b) In committing to his hand  the  universal  administration  of  all  the  precious  graces  and blessings of  the  covenant.  (Matt.  28:18;  John  1:12;  7:39;  17:2;  Acts 2:33.)  (c)  In  the  salvation  of  the  elect,  including  all  general  and special provisions of grace, such as regeneration, justification, sanctification,  perseverance,  and  glory.  (Titus  3:5,6;  Jer.  31:33; 32:40; Isa. 35:10; 53:10,11.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The condition of this covenant was-(1) That he should be born of a woman, made under the law. (Gal. 4:4,5.) (2) That he should assume and discharge,  in  behalf  of  his  elect,  all  the  broken  conditions  and incurred  liabilities  of  the  covenant  of  works  (Matt.  5:17,18),-(a) rendering  that  perfect  obedience  which  is  the  condition  of  the promise of the old covenant (Ps. 40:8; Isa. 13:21; John 8:29; 9:4,5; Matt. 19:17), and (b) suffering the penalty of death incurred by the breaking of the old covenant, (Isa. 53:; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13; Eph. 5:2.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christ, as mediatorial King, administers to his people the benefits of his covenant; and by his providence, his Word, and his Spirit, he causes  them  to  become  severally  recipients  of  these  blessings,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>according to his will. These benefits he offers to all men in the gospel. He promises to grant them on the condition they are received. In the case of his own people, he works faith in them, and as their Surety engages  for  them  and  makes  good  all  that  is  suspended  upon  or conveyed through their agency. In the whole sphere of our experience every Christian duty is a Christian grace; for we can fulfill the conditions of repentance and faith only as it is given to us by our Surety.  All  Christian  graces  also  involve  Christian  duties.  So  that Christ at once purchases salvation for us, and applies salvation to us; commands us to do,  and  works  in  us  to  obey;  offers  us  grace  and eternal life on conditions, and gives us the conditions and the grace and the eternal life. What he gives us he expects us to exercise. What he demands of us he at once gives us. Viewed on God's side, faith and repentance  are  the  gifts  of  the  Son.  Viewed  on  our  side,  they  are duties  and  gracious  experiences,  the  first  symptoms  of  salvation begun-instruments wherewith further grace may be attained. Viewed in  connection  with  the  covenant  of  grace,  they  are  elements  of  the promise of the Father to the Son, conditioned upon his mediatorial work.  Viewed  in  relation to salvation, they are indices of its commencement and conditions sine qua non of its completion.</p>
<p>The present administration of this covenant by Christ, in one aspect, evidently bears a near analogy to a testament or will executed  only consequent upon the death of the testator. And so in one passage our translators were correct in so translating the word diaqhkh . (Heb. 9:16,17.)  But  since  Christ  is  an  ever-living  and  constantly-acting Mediator, the same yesterday, today, and forever, this word, which expresses his present administration, should in every other instance have been translated "dispensation," instead of "testament." (2 Cor. 3:6,14; Gal. 3:15; Heb. 7:22; 12:24; 13:20.)</p>
<p>SECTION 5: THIS covenant was differently administered in the time of  the  law,  and  in  the  time  of  the  gospel;(9)  under  the  law  it  was administered  by  promises,  prophecies,  sacrifices,  circumcision,  the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come,(10) which were for that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,(11) by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the Old Testament.(12)</p>
<p>SECTION 6: UNDER the gospel, when Christ the substance(13) was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are, the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper;(14) which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet in them it is held forth in more fullness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy, (15) to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles;(16) and is called the New Testament.(17)  There  are  not,  therefore,  two  covenants  of  grace differing in substance, but one and the same under various dispensations.(18)</p>

</ul>
<p>These sections  teach  us  concerning  the  covenant  of  grace  as  it  has been manifest in both the old and new dispensations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Covenant adminstered has from the beginning remained in all essential  repsects  the  same,  in  spite  of  all  outward  changes  in  its mode and adminsitration. (1) Christ was the Savior of men before his advent, and he saved them on the same principles then as now. He was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," (Rev. 13:8); "a propitiation for the sins that are past," (Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:15). He was promised to Adam and to Abraham as the Savior of the world. (Gen. 3:15; 17:7); 22:18. He was symbolically exhibited and typically prophesied  by  all  the  ceremonial  and  especially  by  the  sacrificial system  of  the  temple.  (Col.  2:17;  Heb.  10:1-10.)  He  was  especially</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>witnessed to as the Savior from sin by all the prophets. (Acts 10:43.) (2) Faith was the condition of salvation under the old dispensation in the  same  sense  it  is  now.  (Heb.  2:4;  Ps.  2:12.)  The  Old  Testament believers are set up for an example to those who are called to exercise faith  under  the  New  Testament.  (Rom.  4:;  Heb.  11:)  (3)  The  same gracious  promises  of  spiritual  grace  and  eternal  blessedness  were administered then as now. (Compare Gen. 17:7 with Matt. 22:32; and Gen. 22:18 with Gal. 3:16. See, also, Isa. 43:25; Ps. 16:; 51:; 73:24-26; Ezek. 36:27; Job 19:25-27; Dan. 12:2,3.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Under the old dispensatio the covenant of grace was administered chiefly by types and symbolic ordinances, signifying beforehand the coming  of  Christ,  and  thus  administration  was  almost  exclusively confined  to  the  Jewish  nation  with  consstantly  increasing  fulness and  clearness-  (1)  From  Adam  to  Abraham,  in  the  promise  to  the woman  (Gen.  3:15);  the  institution  of  bloody  sacrifices;  and  the constant  visible  appearance  and  audible  converse  of  Jehovah  with his people. (2) From Abraham to Moses, the more definite promise given to Abraham (Gen. 17:7; 22:18), in the Church separated from the  world,  embraced  in  a  special  covenant,  and  sealed  with  the sacrament  of  Circumcision.  (3)  From  Moses  to  Christ,  the  simple primitive  rite  of  sacrifice  developed  into  the  elaborate  ceremonial and  significant symbolism  of  the  temple  service,  the  covenant enriched with new promises, the Church separated from the world by new  barriers,  and  sealed  with  the  additional  sacrament  of  the Passover.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The present dispensation of the covenant is superior to the former one-(1)  Because  while  it  was  formerly  administered  by  Moses,  a servant, it is now administered visibly and immediately by Christ, a son in his own house. Heb. 3:5,6. (2) The truth was then partly hid, partly revealed, in the types and symbols; now it is revealed in clear history  and  didactic  teaching.  (3)  That  revelation  has  been  vastly increased,  as  well  as  rendered  more  clear,  by  the  incarnation  of Christ and the mission of the Holy Ghost. (4) That dispensation was so  encumbered with ceremonies as to be comparatively carnal; the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>present  dispensation  is  spiritual.  (5)  That  was  confined  to  one people:  the  present  dispensation,  disembarrassed  from  all  national organizations, embraces  the  whole  Earth.  (6) That  method  of administration  was  preparatory:  the  present  is  final,  as  far  as  the present order of the world is concerned. It will give way only to that eternal  administration  of  the  covenant  which  shall  be  executed  by the Lamb in the new heavens and the new earth, when there shall "be gathered  together  in  one  all  things  in  Christ,  both  which  are  in heaven, and which are on earth." (Eph. 1:10.) More than this is not yet made known.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-eight-of-christ-the-mediator">Chapter Eight Of Christ The Mediator<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-eight-of-christ-the-mediator" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SECTION 1: IT pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain  the  Lord  Jesus,  his  only  begotten  Son,  to  be  the  Mediator between God and man;(1) the Prophet,(2) Priest,(3) and King;(4) the Head  and  Savior  of  his  Church;(5)  the  Heir  of  all  things;(6)  and Judge  of  the  world:(7)  unto  whom  he  did  from  all  eternity  give  a people to be his seed,(8) and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.(9)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Isa. 42:1; 1 Pet. 1:19,20; John 3:16; 1 Tim. 2:5. (2) Acts 3:22.(3) Heb. 5:5,6. (4) Ps. 2:6; Luke 1:33. (5) Eph. 5:23. (6) Heb. 1:2. (7) Acts 17:31. (8) John 17:6; Ps. 22:30; Isa. 53:10. (9) 1 Tim. 2:6; Isa. 55:4,5; 1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having already established the doctrine of God's sovereign election and the doctrine of the covenant of grace between the Father and His Son,  this  section  teaches  that  Christ  as  mediator  is  both  God  and man, exercising His authority as prophet, priest, and king. Moreover, He is Head and Savior of His Church, Heir of all things, and Judge of the  world.  1.  A  mediator  is  one  who  intervenes  between  contesting parties for the sake of making reconciliation. The term is sometimes applied to independent and disinterested parties called in to arbitrate a difficulty; sometimes to a dependent messenger or agent of one of the parties to the contest employed to carry overtures to the other party. In this sense Moses was a mediator between God and the people of Israel. (Deut. 5:5; Gal. 3:19.) Sometimes it is applied to an intercessor employed by the weaker party to influence the stronger.</p>
<p>The Scriptures apply the term, in a higher sense than any of these, to Christ.  They  teach  that  he  intervenes  between  God  and  man,  not merely  to  sue  for  peace  and  to  persuade  to  it,  but,  armed  with plenipotentiary power, efficiently to make peace and to do all that is necessary to that end.</p>
<p>The things necessary in order to this great end fall into two classes(1) Those that respect God, and (2) Those that respect men.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) As  it respects  God,  it is absolutely  necessary,  in  order  to reconciliation, that the Mediator should propitiate the just</li>
</ul>
<p>displeasure of God by expiating the guilt of sin, and that he should supplicate  in  our  behalf,  and  that  he  should  actually  introduce  our persons and services to the acceptance of the Father.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2)  As  it  respects  men,  it  is  absolutely  necessary  that  the  Mediator should reveal to them the truth concerning God and their relations to him,  and  the  conditions  of  acceptable  service; that he  should persuade and enable them to receive and obey the truth so revealed; and that he should so direct and sustain them, and so control all the outward influences to which they are subjected, that their deliverance from sin and from the powers of an evil world shall be perfected.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence the mediatorial office involves all the three great functions of prophet, priest, and king; and Christ discharged them all, both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These are not three distinct offices meeting  accidentally in one office, but three functions inhering essentially in the one office of mediator. And they each so belong to the very essence of the office that the quality peculiar to each gives character to every mediatorial action. When he teaches, he is  always a priestly and kingly prophet. When he offers sacrifice or intercession for sin, he is always a prophetical and royal priest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) Christ is a Prophet. A prophet is a spokesman; one sent from God to man to make known the divine will. In this sense Moses and all inspired men were prophets. But Christ was the personal "Word of God"  incarnate,  he  who  had  eternally  been  "in  the  bosom  of  the Father,"  and  "known  the  Father";  and  consequently  as  Mediatorial Prophet  is  that  original  fountain  of  revelation  of  which  all  other prophets  are  the  streams.  He  is  the  Prophet  of  all  prophets,  the Teacher of all teachers.</li>
</ul>
<p>"He executes the office of a prophet, in his revealing to the Church, in all ages, by his Spirit and Word, in divers ways of administration, the whole  will  of  God,  in  all  things  concerning  their  edification  and salvation." (L. Cat., q. 43.) That this representation is true is proved from  the  fact  that  the  Scriptures-(a)  Explicitly  call  him  a  prophet. (Compare Deut. 18:15,18  and  Acts  3:22;  7:37;  Heb.  1:2.)  (b)  Teach that he  executed  the  functions  of  a  prophet  before  his  incarnation. (Isa. 9:6; Mal. 3:1; Job 33:23; 1 Pet. 1:11.) (c) Teach that he executes the office of a prophet since his incarnation. (Matt. 11:27; John 3:2; 6:68; Rev. 7:17; 21:3.)</p>
<p>(2) Christ is a Priest. A priest is (a) one taken from among men, (b) to appear in the presence of God and to treat in behalf of men; and (c),  in  order  thereto,  to  make  propitiation  and  intercession.  It  is declared to be essential to the priest-(a) That he be a man chosen to represent men before God. Aaron always bore before the Lord for a memorial  a  breastplate  with  the  names  of  all  the  tribes  of  Israel engraved upon it. (Ex. 28:9,12,21,29.) (b) He must be chosen of God, as  his  special  election  and  property.  (Num.  16:5;  Heb.  5:4.)  (c)  He must be holy and consecrated to the Lord. (Lev. 21:6-8; Ex. 39:30,31; Ps. 106:16.) (d) He must have a right both to draw near to Jehovah and to bring near-i.e., to offer sacrifices and intercessions. (Lev. 16:315.)  (e)  He  must  have  an  acceptable  sacrifice  to  offer.  (Heb.  8:3.) Christ is in this sense a true priest, and he executes this office "in his once  offering  himself  a  sacrifice  without  spot  to  God,  to  be  a reconciliation  for  the  sins  of  his  people;  and  in  making  continual intercession  for  them."  (L.  Cat.,  q.  44.)  That  this  is  true  is  proved from the fact that the Scriptures declare-(a) That Christ possessed all the characteristic marks and qualifications of a priest. He became a man for this purpose. (Heb. 2: I6; 4:15.) He was chosen of God, as was  Aaron.  (Heb.  5:5,6.)  He  was  perfectly  holy,  and  had  right  of immediate approach to the Father. Heb. 8:6. (b) He is declared to be a  priest  in  the  Old  Testament.  The  entire  order  of  priests  and  the ceremonial of sacrifice were typical of him. {Zech. 6:13; Isa. 53:10; Dan.  9:24,25.)  (c)  The  Gospel  history  declares  that  he  actually discharged all the functions of a priest. He has made propitiation by a sacrificial bearing of the penalty due to sin. (Eph. 5:2; Heb. 9:26; 1 John 2:2.) He has made intercession, and he ever lives to intercede. (Rom.  8:34;  Heb.  7:25.)  The  work  of  Christ  was  the  substance  of which  the  entire  ceremonial  of  the  temple  was  the  shadow.  (Col. 2:17.)</p>
<p>His  priesthood  is  said  not  to  have  been  of  the  order  of  Aaron, because, although Aaron and his priesthood were types of Christ. and existed  simply  for  the  purpose  of  showing  forth  his  work,  yet  they were  inadequate  to  represent  him  fully  and  in  all  relations.  They were inadequate chiefly-(a) With respect to the incomparable dignity and excellence of his person. (John 1:1-4,14.) (b) The infinite value of his  sacrifice.  (Heb.  10:1-14.)  (c)  The  manner  of  their  consecration. (Heb. 7:20-22.) (d) They were constantly succeeding each other, as dying  men.  (Heb.  7:23,24.)  (e)  He  was  a  minister  of  a  greater  and more perfect tabernacle. (Heb. 9:11,24.) (f) They were mere priestshe was a royal and prophetical priest. (Zech. 6:13; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 8:1,2.)</p>
<p>His  priesthood  is  said  to  have  been  of  the  order  of  Melchizedek, because-(a) Like him he was a royal priest. (b) Like him, he had no predecessors or successors in office. He was the only one of his line. (c) Because he was an eternal priest: "Thou art a priest forever, of the order of Melchizedek." (Heb. 7:17.)</p>
<p>(3) Christ is sovereign Head over all things to his Church. (Eph. 1:22; 4:15; Col. 1:18; 2:19.) He executes the office of a king-(a) In calling out of the world a people to himself, and giving them offices, laws, and discipline, by which he visibly governs them; (b) In bestowing saving grace upon his elect, rewarding their obedience and correcting them for  their  sins,  and  preserving  and  supporting  them  under  all their temptations and sufferings; (c) In restraining and overcoming all their enemies, and powerfully ordering all things for his own glory and  their  good;  and  also  (d)  In  taking  vengeance  on  the  rest,  who know not God and obey not the gospel.</p>
<p>This  lordship  differs  from  that  which  belongs  essentially  to  the Godhead-(a) Because it is given to him by the Father as the reward of his obedience and suffering. Phil. 2:6-11. (b) The object and design of this mediatorial kingship has special reference to the upbuilding and glory  of  the  redeemed  Church.  (Eph.  1:22,23.)  (c)  The  dignity  and authority belong not to his deity abstractly, but to his entire person as God-man. This power and lordship Christ already possesses, and it extends over all creatures in all worlds. (Matt. 28:18; Eph. 1:17-23; Phil.  2:9-11;  Jer.  23:5;  Isa.  9:6;  Ps.  2:6;  Acts  2:29-36.)  And  of  this kingdom there shall be no end. (Dan. 2:44; Isa. 9:7.)</p>
<p>Thus Christ has been shown, as Mediator, to be-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Head  and  Savior  of  his  Church,  and  Heir  of  all  things;  that  is, sovereign  ruler  and  disposer  of  all  things  throughout  all  worlds. (Eph.  1:10.)  That  element  of  Christ's  dominion  which  shall  be exercised in his judging men and angels at the end will be considered under chapter 33.</li>

<p>SECTION 2: THE Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did,  when  the  fullness  of  time  was  come,  take  upon  him  man's nature,(10) with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin;(11) being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary of her substance.(12) So that two  whole,  perfect,  and  distinct  natures,  the  Godhead  and  the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion.(13) Which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man.(14)</p>
<p>(10) John 1:1,14; 1 John 5:20; Phil. 2:6; Gal. 4:4. (11) Heb. 2:14,16,17; 4:15.  (12)  Luke  1:27,31,35;  Gal.  4:4.  (13)  Luke  1:35;  Col.  2:9;  Rom. 9:5; 1 Pet. 3:18; 1 Tim. 3:16. (14) Rom. 1:3,4; 1 Tim. 2:5.</p>
<p>The  subject  of  this  section  is  the  constitution  of  the  person  of  the Mediator  as  the  God-man.  Having  proven  (ch.  2.,  s.  3)  that  Jesus Christ  is  the  one  God;  the  second  person  of  the  Trinity,  of  one substance and equal with the Father, this section further dwells on the perssonality and natures of Christ.</p>
<p>The most ancient and universally accepted statement of the Church doctrine as to the person of Christ is that which was formed by the fourth  General  Council,  consisting  of  "six  hundred  and  thirty  holy and  blessed  fathers,"  who  were  convened  in  Chalcedon  A.D.  451: "We,  then,  following  the  holy  Fathers,  all  with  one  consent,  teach men to confess  one  and  the  same  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  the same perfect  in  Godhead,  and  also  perfect  in  manhood;  truly  God and truly  man,  of  a  reasonable  soul  and  body;  consubstantial  with the  Father  according  to  the  Godhead,  and  consubstantial  with  us according  to  the  manhood;  in  all  things  like  unto  us  without  sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, according to the manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only Begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably, the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property  of  each  nature  being  preserved  and  concurring  in  one Person and one Substance, not parted or divided into two persons, but  one  and  the  same  Son  and  Only  begotten,  God  the  Word,  the Lord Jesus Christ, as the prophets have from the beginning declared concerning  him,  and  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  himself  has  taught  us, and the creed of the holy Fathers has delivered to us."-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Jesus  of  Nazareth  was  a  true  man,  possessing  all  the  essential properties of humanity, conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost in the  womb  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  of  her  substance  This  includes  two constituent propositions-(1) Jesus Christ vas a true and proper man, possessing all the essential properties of humanity. He is constantly and characteristically  called  the  Man  Christ  Jesus,  and  the  Son  of Man. (Matt. 8:20; 1 Tim. 2:5.) He had a true body, for he ate, drank, slept,  and increased in stature. (Luke 2:52.) Through his whole life he was in all public and private association recognized as a true man. He died in agony on the cross, was buried, rose again, and proved his</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>identity  by  physical  signs.  (Luke  24:36-44.)  He  had  a  reasonable soul,  for  he  increased  in  wisdom,  loved,  sympathized,  wept  and shrank from suffering as a man. (John 11:33-35; Matt. 26:36-46.) (2) The human nature of Jesus is not an independent creation merely. Like ours, but it was generated out of the common life of our race, of the  very  substance  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  by  the  power  of  the  Holy Ghost. The angels do not constitute a race produced by generation, but  only  a  collection  of  individuals.  This  distinction  is  emphasized when  it  is  declared  of  Christ,  "He  took  not  on  him  the  nature  of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham." (Heb. 2:16.) He is the seed of Eve (Gen. 3:15); the seed of David ( Rom. 1:3.) He was made of a woman (Gal. 4:4); conceived by her in her womb (Luke 1:31; 2:5-7).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Jesus, although tempted in all points like as we are, was yet absolutely without sin, is expressly declared in Scripture. (Heb. 4:15.) Peter testifies of him that "he did no sin, neither was guile found in his  mouth."  (1  Pet.  2:22.)  John  testifies  that  "in  him  is  no  sin."  (1 John 3:5; Heb. 7:26; Luke 1:35.) The same is evident from the origin and  constitution  of  his  person  as  the  Incarnate  Word;  from  the nature of the work he came to perform as the deliverer of men from sin; and from the record of his holy life preserved by the evangelists, which  remains,  in  the  constrained  acknowledgments  of  infidels  as well as the faith of Christians, the great moral miracle of all ages.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That he was no less very God, the eternal Son of the Father, has been already proven. Ch. 2., s. 3.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That, nevertheless, this God and this man is one single person, is proven in every way that such a truth can be verified. (1) In all the record  of  his  life there  is no  word  spoken  of  him,  no  action performed by him, no attribute predicated of him, that suggests the idea  that  he  is  not  one  single,  indivisible  person.  (2)  The  personal pronouns are always used by him and applied to him as if he were a single person. Of the same subject and in the same connection divine attributes and actions and human  attributes and actions are</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>predicated. (3) To make the matter more certain and evident, there are passages in which the person is designated by a title proper to his divine  nature,  while  the  attribute  or  action  predicated  of  him  is proper to his human nature; e.g., "The Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28); "Crucified the Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8.) (4) There are other passages in which the person is designated  by  a  title  proper  to  the  human  nature,  while  the attribute  or  action  predicated  of  it  is  proper  to  the  divine  nature: "The Son of man, who is in heave," (John 3:13); "If Ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before" (John 6:62). (5) There are other passages in which divine and human attributes and actions are indiscriminately predicated of the same person: "Who hath . . . translated  us  into  the  kingdom  of  his  dear  Son:  in  whom  we  have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature . . . and having made peace through the blood of his cross," etc. (Col. 1:13-20; Heb. 1:3.)</p>
<ol>
<li>This personality is that of the eternal Son of God, who in time took a  human  soul  and  body  into  personal  union  with  himself.  This remarkable  person  did  not  begin  to  exist,  and  therefore  was  not constituted,  when  he  was  conceived  in  the  womb  of  the  Virgin. "Before Abraham was, I am," he says. (John 8:58.) "The Word was made flesh."  (John  1:14.)  "God  sent  his  only  begotten  Son  into  the world." (1 John 4:9.) The Son was "made of a woman, made under the law." (Gal. 4:4.) "Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and  blood,  he  also  himself  likewise  took  part  of  the  same."  (Heb. 2:14;  Phil.  2:6-11.)  Hence  it  is  evident  that  the  person  of  Christ  is divine, and not human-eternal, and not formed in time. But in time this eternal divine person took a human nature (soul and body) into its  personality.  Just  as  the  body,  with  its  wonderful  constitution  of organs, nerves, senses, and passions, has no personality of its own, but, during its entire life in the womb, grows into the personality of the soul; so the human nature of Christ never for an instant had a separate  personal  existence  of  its  own,  but,  from  the  instant  of  its conception,  grew  into  the  eternal  personality  of  the  Son  of  God.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are in Christ, therefore, two natures, but one person; a human as  well  as  a  divine  nature,  but  only  a  divine  person.  His  humanity began to exist in the womb of the Virgin, but his person existed from eternity. His divinity is personal, his humanity impersonal, and his divine nature and his human nature one person.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Although but one person, the divine and human natures in Christ are not mixed or confused in one, but remain two pure and distinct natures, divine and human, constituting one person forever.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is impossible  for  us  to  explain  philosophically  how  two  selfconscious  intelligences,  how  two  self-determined  free  agents,  can constitute  one  person;  yet  this  is  the  precise  character  of  the phenomenon revealed in the history of Jesus. In order to simplify the matter,  some  errorists  have  supposed  that  in  the  person  of  Christ there was no human soul, but that his divine spirit took the place of the human soul in his human body. Others have so far separated the two natures as to make him two persons-a God and a man intimately united. Others have so pressed the natures together that neither pure divinity nor pure humanity is left, but a new nature resulting from the  mixing  of  both.  That  Christ's  two  natures  remain  separate  and unconfused, is self-evident. The very point proved in Scripture is that Christ always continued a true God and true man-not something else between  the  two.  The  essential  properties  of  divinity  cannot  be communicated to humanity-that is, humanity cannot be made to be infinite, self- eternal, and absolutely perfect; because, if it possessed these,  it  would  cease  to  be  human;  and  because  even  God  himself cannot create divinity, and therefore cannot make humanity divine. The same is true with respect to Christ's divinity. If that should take on the limitations of humanity, it would cease to be divine, and even God is not able to destroy divinity. Hence, since Christ is both God and  man,  it  follows  that  he  cannot  be  a  mixture  of  both,  which  is neither.  Hence,  while  the  Scriptures  constantly  affirm  (as  we  have seen)  of  the  one  person  whatsoever  is  true,  without  exception,  of either nature, they never affirm of either nature that which belongs to the other. It is said that God-i.e., the person who is a God-gave his blood for his Church; but it is never said that his divinity died, or that his humanity came down from heaven.</p>
<p>SECTION 3: THE Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine,  was  sanctified  and  anointed  with  the  Holy  Spirit  above measure;(15) having in him  all the treasures of wisdom  and knowledge;(16) in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell;(17) to the end, that being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth,(18) he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the office  of  a  Mediator  and  Surety.(19)  Which  office  he  took  not  unto himself,  but  was  thereunto  called  by  his  Father;(20)  who  put  all power and judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the same.(21)</p>
<p>SECTION  4: THIS office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake;(22)  which  that  he  might  discharge  he  was  made  under the  law,(23)  and  did  perfectly  fulfill  it;(24)  endured  most  grievous torments immediately in his soul,(25) and most painful sufferings in his body;(26) was crucified, and died;(27) was buried, and remained under  the  power  of  death,  yet  saw  no  corruption(28)  On  the  third day  he  arose  from  the  dead,(29)  with  the  same  body  in  which  he suffered;(30)  with  which  also  he  ascended  into  heaven,  and  there sitteth at the right hand of his Father,(31) making intercession;(32) and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world.(33)</p>

<p>Now  these sections proceed to addres the effect of Christ's hypostatical union upon his human nature; His unique function as Mediatorial  God-Man,  having  been  voluntarily  appointed  to  this office  by  the  Father;  His  discharging  of  Mediatorial  functions  in humiliation and in exaltation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  effect  of  this  hypostatical  union  upon  the  human  nature  of Christ was not to deify it, since, as we saw above, the human nature as well as the divine nature remains pure, separate, and unchanged, after  as  before.  But  the  effect  of  this  union  was-(1)  To  exalt  the human  nature  of  Christ  to  a  degree  of  dignity  and  honor  greatly beyond  that  attained  by  any  other  creature.  (2)  To  fill  it  with  a perfection  of  intellectual  and  moral  excellence  beyond  that  of  any other creature. The Father gave not the Spirit by measure unto him. (John  3:34.)  "It  pleased  the  Father  that  in  him  should  all  fullness dwell." (Col. 1: l9.) His person, therefore, possessed all the properties belonging to absolute divinity, and an all-perfect and incomparably exalted manhood, and was thoroughly furnished to execute the office of Mediator and Surety.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence  Christ  was  Mediator,  and  discharged  all  the  functions  of that office, not as God, nor as man, but as God-man. As this point is more directly called up by the seventh section of this chapter, it will be considered in that place.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Christ was appointed to this office by the Father, and acts in it upon an authority derived from the Father, is very prominently as well as clearly set forth in Scripture: "And no man takes this honour unto  himself,  but  he  that  is  called  of  God,  as  was  Aaron.  So  also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but . . . he was called of  God  an  high  priest  after  the  order  of  Melchizedek."  (Heb. 5:4-10.) Christ constantly affirms that he was "sent by the Father"; that the Father had given him "a commandment"; that the "works" which he performed and the "words" which he spoke were not his, but the Father's that sent him. "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>will,  but  the  will  of  the  Father  which  hath  sent  me."  (John  5:30.) "Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me." (John 7:16.) "If  ye  loved  me,  ye  would  rejoice,  because  I said,  I  go  unto  the  Father;  for  my  Father  is  greater  than  I."  (John 14:24,28,31; 10:18; 12:49; 4:34.)</p>
<p>The Eternal Word is of the same identical substance with and equal to  the  Father  in  power  and  glory.  But  the  God-man,  in  his  official relations  and  works,  is  officially,  and  as  far  as  concerns  these relations and  actions  alone,  inferior to the Father-sent  by  his authority, acting for him, returning and accounting to him.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That nevertheless Christ took this office and all it involved upon himself  voluntarily  is  very  evident-(1)  Because  otherwise,  being absolute  God,  it  could  never  have  been  imposed  upon  him.  (2) Because  otherwise  his  obedience  and  suffering  could  not  have vicariously availed for us. (3) Because otherwise the execution of the law upon him would have been outrageously unjust. (4) Because it is expressly  declared.  Speaking  of  his  life,  he  said,  "No  man  takes  it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and I  have  power  to  take  it  again."  (John  10:18.)  The  motive  which impelled him to the self-sacrificing undertaking was a personal love for his people "which passes knowledge." (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 3:19; 5:2.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christ  discharged  the  functions  of  the  mediatorial  office  in  his estate of humiliation, which consists-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) In his being born, and that in a low condition. It is evident that nothing could be added to the divine perfections by the assumption of a human nature into a personal relation. On the other hand it is an act  of  infinite  condescension  on  the  part  of  the  Godhead  of  Jesus, and of transcendent and permanent benefit to the whole intelligent creation, that all the fullness of the Godhead should be contained in him bodily, and so revealed under the limitations of a finite nature. For it is only thus that the Infinite can be "seen and known," "tasted</li>
</ul>
<p>and  handled,"  and  that  of  "his  fullness"  we  may  all  receive,  and "grace for grace" (John 1:16,18; 1 John 1:1.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) In his being made under the law, and rendering perfect obedience to it. The law lays its claims not upon natures, but upon persons. The person of Christ was eternal and divine. Personally, therefore, he was the  norm,  the  Author  and  Lord  of  the  law,  his  divine  perfections being the necessary and supreme Law to himself and to the universe he had made. Therefore he owed nothing to the law, since the law was conformed to him, not he to the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>But,  as  we  have  seen,  chap.  7.,  s.  3,  in  the  covenant  of  grace  the Mediator assumes in behalf of his elect seed the broken conditions of the  old  covenant  of  works  precisely  as  Adam  left  them.  In  that covenant  punishment  was  conditioned  upon  disobedience,  and  life and blessedness upon obedience. Therefore it was necessary that the "second Adam" should render vicarious obedience in order to secure for his people the promised reward, as well as that he should suffer the  penalty  in  order  to  secure  for  them  the  remission  of  sins.  By Christ's  suffering  (passive  obedience),  our  Confession  teaches,  he purchases for us reconciliation; while by his fulfilling the precepts of the  law  (active  obedience)  he  purchases  for  us  "an  everlasting inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven."  Chap.  8.,  s.  5.  Christ, therefore, was "made under the law" (Gal. 4:4,5), (a) Not as a rule of righteousness,  but  as  a  condition  of  blessedness,  "to  redeem  them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." (b) Not for himself, but officially as our representative. (c) His whole obedience of that law was vicarious-instead of our obedience and for our sakes. "By the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (Rom. 5:19.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(3) His undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the cross. Christ was the representative of his people, and all his obedience and suffering was vicarious, from his birth until all the conditions of the covenant of life were fulfilled. All his earthly career was in one aspect suffering, in another aspect obedience. As</li>
</ul>
<p>suffering,  it  was  a  vicarious  endurance  of  the  penalty  of  sin.  As obedience, it was the discharge in the stead and behalf of his people of that condition upon which their eternal inheritance is suspended. The  two  were  never  separated  in  fact.  They  are  only  the  two  legal aspects  presented  by  the  same  life  of  suffering  obedience.  The essence of the penalty vicariously borne by Christ was "the wrath of God."  The  incidents  of  it  were  "the  miseries  of  this  life."  The culmination  of  it  was  "the  cursed  death  of  the  cross,"  (Gen.  2:17; Heb. 9:22.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(4) In his being buried, and continuing under the power of death for a  time.  In  the  Creed  commonly  called  the  Apostles'  Creed,  and adopted  by  all  the  Churches,  this  last  stage  of  the  humiliation  of Christ is expressed by the phrase, "He descended into hell" (Hades, the  invisible  world).  This  means  precisely  what  our  Confession affirms, that while  the  body  of  Jesus  remained  buried  in  the sepulcher  his  soul  remained  temporarily  divorced  from  it  in  the unseen world of spirits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some (as Pearson on the Creed, pp. 333-371) have held that as Christ died vicariously as a sinner, so, in order to fulfill the law of death, his soul went temporarily to the place where the souls of those who die for their own sins die the second death forever.</p>
<p>The Lutherans teach that  the  descent  of  the  God-man  into  hell,  in order to triumph over Satan and his angels in the very citadel of his kingdom, was the first step in his exaltation. (Form. Of Concord, part 2., chap. 9.)</p>
<p>The  Romanists  teach  that  Christ  went,  while  his  body  was  in  the grave, to that department of Hades (invisible world) which they call the Limbus Patrum , where the believers under the old dispensation were gathered, to preach the gospel to them, and to take them with him to the heaven he had prepared for them. (Cat. of the Coun. of Trent, part 1., art. 5.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>He  executed  the  functions  of  his  mediatorial  office  also  in  his estate of exaltation, which consisted-</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In  his  rising  from  the  dead  on  the  third  day.  The  fact  of  his resurrection is proved. (a) Predicted in the Old Testament. (Compare Ps. 16:10;  Acts  2:24-31.)  (b)  Christ  himself  predicted  it.  Matt. 20:18,19; John 10:17,8. (c) The witness of the eleven apostles. (Acts 1:3.) (d) The separate testimony of Paul. (1 Cor. 15:8; Gal. 1:12; Acts 9:3-8.)  (e)  He  was  seen  by  five  hundred  brethren  at  once.  (1  Cor. 15:6.) (f) The miracles wrought by the apostles in attestation of the fact. (Heb. 2:4.) (g) The witness of the Holy Ghost. (Acts 5:32.) (h) The change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week.</p>
<p>The  importance  of  the  fact  is  proved  to  be  fundamental.  (a)  The resurrection  of  Christ  is  the  pledge  for  the  fulfillment  of  all  the prophecies and promises of both Testaments. (b) It proved him to be the Son of God, because it authenticated his claims, and because he rose  by  his  own  power.  (John  2:19;  10:17.)  (c)  It  was  a  public acceptance  of  his  mediatorial  work  in  our  behalf  by  the  Father. (Rom. 4:25.) (d) Hence we have an advocate with the Father. (1 John 2:1; Rom. 8:34.) (e) "If Christ lives, we shall live also." (John 14:19; 1 Pet. 1:3-5; 1 Cor. 15:21,22.) (f) His resurrection secures ours. (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 6:15; 15:49; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(2) In his ascending up into heaven. This took place forty clays after his  resurrection,  from  a  portion  of  the  Mount  of  Olives  near  to Bethany,  in  the  presence  of  the  eleven  apostles  and  possibly  other disciples.  He  ascended  as  Mediator,  triumphing  over  his  enemies and  giving  gifts to his friends (Eph.  4:8-12), to complete  his mediatorial work, as the forerunner of his people (John 14:2, 3; Heb. 6:20), and to fill the universe with the manifestations of his power and glory. (Eph. 4:10.)</li>
<li>(3)  In  his  sitting  at  the  right  hand  of  God  the  Father,  where  he intercedes for, and reigns over all things in the behalf of, his people.</li>
</ul>
<p>The passages which speak of this session of the Mediator at the right hand of  the  Father  are,  Ps.  16:1l;  110:1;  Dan.  7:13,14;  Matt.  26:64; Mark 16:19; John 5:22; Rom. 8:34; Eph. 1:20,22; Phil. 2:9-11; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3,4; 2:9; 10:12; 1 Pet. 3:22; Rev. 5:6. This right hand of God denotes the official exaltation of the Mediator to supreme glory, felicity, and  dominion  over  every  name  that  is named.  It is, moreover, a definite  place,  since  the  finite  soul  and  body  of  Christ must be in a definite place, and there his glory is revealed and his authority exercised. There he intercedes for his people, a priest upon his  throne  (Zech.  6:13);  and  hence  he  effectually  applies  to  his people, by his Spirit, that salvation which he had previously achieved for them in his estate of humiliation.</p>
<p>With the presentation of "his  own  blood"  (Heb.  9:12,24)  he  pleads for those who are embraced in his covenant, and for those blessings in  their  behalf  which  in  that  covenant  were  conditioned  upon  his obedience and suffering. (John 17:9; Luke 22:32; see John 17.) His intercession  is  always  prevalent  and  successful.  (John  11:42;  Ps. 21:2.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(4)  In  his  coming  to  judge  the  world  at  the  last  day.  This  will  be discussed in its proper place, under chapter 33.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 5: THE Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, has fully satisfied the justice of his Father,(34) and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given to him. (35)</p>
<p>SECTION 6: ALTHOUGH the work of redemption was not actually wrought by Christ until after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and  benefits  thereof,  were  communicated  to  the  elect  in  all  ages successively  from  the  beginning  of  the  world,  in  and  by  those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed and signified  to  be  the  Seed  of  the  woman,  which  should  bruise  the serpent's head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, being yesterday and today the same, and forever.(36)</p>
<p>(34)  Rom.  5:19;  Heb.  9:14,16;  10:14;  Eph.  5:2;  Rom.  3:25,26.  (35) Dan. 9:24,26; Col. 1:19,20; Eph. 1:11,14; John 17:2; Heb. 9:12,15. (36) Gal. 4:4,5; Gen. 3:15; Rev. 13:8; Heb. 13:8.</p>
<p>Compare chapter 11., s. 3: "Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully  discharge  the  debt  of  all  those  that  are  thus  justified,  and  did make  a  proper,  real,  and  full  satisfaction  to  his  Father's  justice  in their behalf."</p>
<p>These sections teach us of the effects of Christ's mediatorial work on earth:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Christ made satisfaction for those whom he represented, both by  his  obedience  and  by,  his  sacrifice  of  himself,  has  been  shown above  (chap.  7.,  s.  3,  and  8.,  s.  4).  This  truth  is  taught  in  the Confessions  of  all the Churches,  Lutheran  and  Reformed.  The Heidelberg Catechism, one of the most generally adopted of all the Reformed Confessions, says, question 60: "God, without any merit of mine but only of mere grace, grants and imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, . . . as if I had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ hath accomplished for me."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Formula of Concord, a Lutheran Confession, says: "Since Christ was not only man, but God and man in one undivided person, so he was  not  subject  to  the  law,  nor  obnoxious  to  suffering  and  death, because he was the Lord of the law. On which account his obedience is  imputed  to  us;  so  that  God  on  account  of  that  whole  obedience (which Christ by his acting and by his suffering, in his life and in his death, for our sake rendered to his Father who is in heaven) remits our sins, reputes us as good and just, and gives us eternal salvation."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christ  thus  has,  in  strict  rigor,  fully  satisfied  all  the  demands  of divine justice upon those whom he represents. Jesus Christ has met</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the  divine  demand  that  the  original  covenatn  of  works  be  fulfilled through the sorrow of His life and death, and he has met the divine demand for  essential  justice  in  the  punishment  of  sin  through  the obedience  unto  death.  Christ  suffered  as  the  representative  of sinners. Our sins were laid upon him. He, "hath redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us." He died, "the just for the unjust." "He is the propitiation (expiation) for our sins." He "gave his life a ransom for many." We are "bought with a price." (Gal. 3:13;  1  Pet.  3:18;  1  John  2:2;  Matt.  20:28;  1  Cor.  6:20.)  Christ suffered only in his single human soul and body, and only for a time. Nevertheless, his person was the infinite and transcendently glorious person of the eternal Son of God. Consequently his sufferings were precisely,  both  in  kind  and  in  degree,  what  the  infinitely  righteous wisdom of God saw to be in strict rigor a full equivalent, in respect to the  demands  of  legal  justice,  for  the  eternal  sufferings  of  all  for whom  he  suffered.  This  is  the  doctrine  of  the  whole  Christian Church. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, say, Art. 31:  "The  offering  of  Christ,  once  made,  is  that  perfect  redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual."</p>
<p>The Catechism of the Council of Trent, 2.5, 63: "Whatever is due by us to God on account of our sins has been paid abundantly, although he should deal with us according to the strictest rigor of his justice. . . . For it we are indebted to Christ alone, who, having paid the price of our sins on the cross, most fully satisfied God."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  thus  he  has,  according  to  the  terms  of  the  everlasting covenant, not only secured in behalf of those whom he represented remission  of  sins  and  propitiation  of  divine  wrath,  but  also  an everlasting  inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  glory.  The  sufferings  of Christ secure  the remission  of  the penalty; and  by  his active obedience, according to the terms of the covenant made with Adam and  assumed  by  Christ,  he  purchases  a  right  to  life  and  eternal blessedness.  That  he  has  so  purchased  eternal  life  for  all  those  in whose stead he rendered obedience, is proved from the fact that the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scriptures habitually set forth the truth that the "adoption of sons" and "eternal life" are given to the believer freely for Christ's sake, as elements of that purchased possession of which the Holy Spirit is the earnest.  (Eph.  1:11-14;  Rom.  8:15-17;  Gal.  1:4;  3:13,14;  4:4,5;  Eph. 5:25-27; Titus 3:5,6; Rev. 1:5,6; 5:9,10.)</p>
<p>This proves, therefore-(1) That Christ did not die simply to make the salvation  of  those  for  whom  he  died  possible-i.e.,  to  remove  legal obstructions to their salvation-but that he died with the design and effect  of  actually  securing  their  salvation  and  of  endowing  them gratuitously with an inalienable title to heaven. (2) It proves, in the second place, that the vicarious sufferings of Christ must have been, in design  and  effect, personal  and  definite  as  to their object. Salvation  must  be  applied  to  all  those  for  whom  it  was  purchased. Since not the possibility or opportunity for reconciliation, but actual reconciliation itself was purchased; since not only reconciliation, but a title to an eternal inheritance was purchased, it follows (a) That "to all those  for  whom  Christ  hath  purchased  redemption,  he  doth certainly  and  effectually  apply  and  communicate  the  same."  (Conf. Faith, ch. 8. s. 8.) And  (b)  That  he  who  never  receives  the inheritance,  and  to  whom  the  purchased  grace  is  never  applied,  is not one of the persons for whom it was purchased.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That although this satisfaction was rendered by Christ only after his incarnation yet the full benefits thereof had been applied to each of the elect severally in their successive  generations  from  the beginning, by the Holy Ghost, through the various forms of truth to them made known. This has been proved at length and illustrated (chap. 7. ss. 5, 6).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 7:  CHRIST,  in  the  work  of  mediation,  acts  according  to both natures; by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;(37) yet by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature.(38)</p>
<p>(37) Heb. 9:14; 1 Pet. 3:18. (38) Acts 20:28; John 3:13; 1 John 3:16.</p>
<p>Under section 2. we saw-(1) That Jesus of Nazareth was a true man. (2)  That  he  was  true  God.  (3)  That  he  was  nevertheless  one  single person.  (4)  That  his  personality  is  eternal  and  divine,  his  human nature  having  been  generated  into  the  pre-existent  person  of  the Son. (5) That these two natures remain one person, yet distinct and unchanged  divinity  and  humanity,  without  mixture  or  confusion. This section proceeds to state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  all Christ's mediatorial actions involve the concurrent activities  of  both  natures,  each  nature  contributing  that  which  is proper to itself.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus  the  divine  nature  of  Christ  is  that  fountain  from  which  his revelation as prophet is derived. Other prophets reflect his light, or transmit what they receive from him. He is the original source of all divine knowledge. At the same time his humanity is the form through which his Godhead is revealed, his flesh the veil through which its glory is transmitted. His person as incarnate God is the focus of all revelations-the subject as well as the organ  of all prophetical teaching.</p>
<p>Thus, also, the human nature of Christ was necessary in order that his person should be "made under the law"; and it is the subject of his vicarious sufferings, and the organ of his vicarious obedience and intercession as our representative Priest and Intercessor. At the same time,  it  is  only  the  supreme  dignity  of  his  divine  person  which renders  his  obedience  supererogatory  and  therefore  vicarious,  and the temporary and finite sufferings of his humanity a full equivalent in justice-satisfying efficacy for the eternal sufferings of all the elect. Thus, also, the activities of his divinity and humanity are constantly and  beautifully  blended  in  all  his  administrative  acts  as  King.  The last  Adam,  the  second  Man,  the  Head  of  a  redeemed  and  glorified race, the First-born among many brethren, he has dominion over all creatures; and with a human heart acting out through the energies of divine wisdom and power, he makes all things work together for the accomplishment of his purposes of love.</p>
<p>All mediatorial acts are therefore to be attributed to the entire person of  the  Theanthropos-God-man.  And  in  the  whole  or  his  glorious person is he to be obeyed and worshipped by angels and men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Because of the unity of both natures in one person, that which is proper  to  either  nature  belongs  of  course  to  that  one  person;  and sometimes  in  Scripture  that  which  is  proper  to  one  nature  is attributed to the person denominated by the other nature. Thus, as shown above under section 2., the Scriptures often say that God shed his  blood  for  his  Church,  or  that  the  Son  of  man  came  down  from heaven, while they never say that the human nature of Christ came down from heaven, or that his divine nature suffered for his Church.</li>
</ol>

<p>SECTION 8: TO all those for whom Christ has purchased redemption, he certainly and effectually applies and communicates the  same;(39)  making  intercession  for  them;(40)  and  revealing  to them, in and by the Word, the mysteries of salvation;(41) effectually persuading  them  by  his  Spirit  to  believe  and  obey;  and  governing their hearts by his Word and Spirit;(42) overcoming all their enemies by his almighty power and wisdom, in such manner and ways as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation.(43)</p>

<h2 id="this-section-teaches">This section teaches:<a class="headerlink" href="#this-section-teaches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Christ, as mediatorial King, seated at the right hand of God, applies  the  redemption  he  had  effected  as  Priest  to  the  proper subjects of it. This point has been already discussed under chap. 7., s. 4,  and  chap.  8.  ss.  1,  4,  when  we  were  treating  of  Christ,  the  Head</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and Surety of the covenant and mediatorial King, and of his session at the right hand of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That he proceeds in the effectual application of redemption in the use of each of the four following methods: (1) By making intercession for the persons concerned. (2) By the revelation of the mysteries of salvation to them in his Word. (3) By the effectual operation of his Spirit  on  their  hearts.  (4)  By  all  necessary  dispensations  of  his providence. The discussion of these points must be looked for under the  several  heads  of  "The  Holy  Scripture,"  "Providence,"  "God's Covenant  with  Man,"  "Christ  the  Mediator,"  "Effectual  Calling," "Justification," etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Christ doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate redemption to ALL THOSE for whom he has purchased it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Standards, it will be observed, very explicitly teach that Christ, as  mediatorial  Priest,  made  expiation  and  purchased  salvation  for certain definite persons. Thus, in chap. 3. s. 6, it is said: "As God has appointed the elect unto glory, so has he by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto. Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ. . . .  Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, . . . but the elect only." Here it is expressly affirmed (1) That Christ died upon the cross on purpose  to  carry  out  the  eternal  purpose  of  God  in  the  election  of certain  individuals  to  eternal  life.  (2)  That  Christ  died  for  the purpose of saving no other than the elect.</p>
<p>In  chap.  8.,  s.  5:  "The  Lord  Jesus,  by  his  perfect  obedience  and sacrifice  of  himself,  .  .  .  purchased  not  only  reconciliation,  but  an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given to him." Here it is expressly taught-(1) That the design of Christ in dying was not simply to make the salvation of all men possible, but actually to purchase reconciliation for those given to him by the Father. (2) That for the same persons Christ actually purchases, and consequently infallibly secures, an eternal inheritance in heaven.</p>
<p>In chapter 8., s. 8, it is said: "TO ALL THOSE for whom Christ has purchased  redemption,  he  certainly  and  effectually  applies and communicates  the  same."  L.  Cat.,  q.  59:  "Redemption  is  certainly applied, and effectually communicated, to all those for whom Christ has purchased it." When this Confession was written, the phrase "to purchase  redemption"  was  used  in  the  sense  in  which  we  use  the phrase "make atonement for sin." So it was so used by Baxter in his work, "Universal Redemption of Mankind by the Lord Jesus Christ"; and  by  Dr.  Isaac  Barrow  in  his  sermon  entitled  "The  Doctrine  of Universal Redemption Asserted and Explained." Dr. Henry B. Smith, in  his  edition  of  Hagenbach,  vol.  2.,  pp.  356,  357,  says  that  our Confession uses the phrase in the same sense.</p>
<p>The entire truth upon this subject, as set forth in our Standards, may be stated summarily in the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God  has  acted  from the beginning, in all his works, according to one  changeless,  all-comprehensive  plan.  Being  infinitely  wise  and powerful, his  design  is  always  fully  executed,  and  therefore  is  fully revealed in the event. God, therefore, intended to accomplish by the vicarious obedience and sufferings of Christ precisely what he does accomplish-nothing more, and nothing less.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The satisfaction rendered by Christ is amply sufficient for all men who can possibly be created.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is exactly adapted to the legal relations and wants of every manof one man as well as of another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence it has forever removed out of the way all legal obstacles to God's saving any man he wills to save.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is freely, authoritatively, and in good faith offered to every man to whom the gospel comes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence it follows-(1) This redemption is rightfully the possession of any man whatsoever who accepts. (2) It is objectively available to one hearer of the gospel as much as to another, upon the single condition of acceptance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>But, since all men are dead in trespasses and sins, no man accepts it except those to whom it is effectually applied by the Holy Ghost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It  is  effectually  applied  precisely  to  those  persons  to  whom  the Father and the Son will to apply it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since  God's  purposes  are  all  eternal  and  immutable,  the  Father and  the  Son  will  to  apply  it  now  precisely  to  those  to  whom  they designed  to  apply  it  when  Christ  hung  upon  the  cross,  and  they willed to apply it then precisely to those to whom they had designed to apply it from eternity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence it follows-(1) Christ died with the purpose of executing the decree of election. (2) His design in making atonement was definite, having respect to certain definite persons-the elect, and none others. (3)  He  designed to secure the salvation of those for whose sake he rendered  satisfaction;  not  merely  to  make  their  salvation  possible, but  to  purchase  for  them  inalienably  faith  and  repentance,  actual reconciliation  and  the  adoption  of  sons,  etc.,  etc.  (4)  He  in  time applies it effectually and certainly to all those for whom he purchased it.</li>

<p>Note.-Mr. Calamy, who represented the most moderate Calvinism entertained  by  any  members  of  the  Assembly,  said  (see  Mitchell's "Minutes  of  West.  Ass.,"  ed.  AD  1874,  p.152),  "I  am  far  from universal redemption in the Arminian sense, but that I hold is in the sense of our divines in the Synod of Dort, that Christ did pay a price for all-absolute for the elect, conditional intention for the reprobate, in case  they  do  believe-that  all  men  should  be  salvibiles  non obstante lapsu Adami."</p>

<h2 id="chapter-nine-of-free-will">Chapter Nine Of Free Will<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-nine-of-free-will" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Section I: God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that  it  is  neither  forced,  nor,  by  any  absolute  necessity  of  nature, determined to good, or evil.[1]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>James  1:13-14;  4:7;  Deut.  30:19;  Isa.  7:11-12;  Matt.  17:12;  John 5:40</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  section  teaches  the  great  fundamental  truth  of  consciousness and.  revelation,  which  renders  moral  government  possible  --  that man, in virtue of his creation, is endowed with an inalienable faculty of self-determination, the power of acting or not acting, and of acting in the way which the man himself, upon the whole view of the case, desires at the time. There are only three generically different views upon this subject possible: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  which  regards  the  actions  of  men  as  caused  directly  by outward circumstances and occasions, under the same great law of necessity which governs the movements of all material agents.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That affected by the Arminians and others, which regards the will in  man,  or  his  bare  faculty  of  volition,  as  possessing  o,  mysterious capacity  of  self-determination,  irrespective  of  all  the  judgments  of the understanding and the affections of the heart and the entire state of the man's soul it the time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  which  is  taught  in  this  section  --  namely,  that  the  human soul,  including  all  its  instincts,  ideas,  judgments,  affections,  and tendencies, has the power of self-decision; that is, the soul decides in every case as, upon the whole, it pleases.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That  the  first-stated  view  is  not  true  is  proved  --  (1.)  From  the universal consciousness of men with respect to their own action, and observation  of  the  action  of  other  men.  We  are  all  conscious  of possessing the power of determining our own action irrespective of any or of all external influences. In every case of deliberate choice we are  conscious  that  we  might  have  chosen  the  opposite  if  we  had wished  to  do  so,  all  outward  circumstances  remaining  unchanged. We see that all material substances act only as they are acted upon, and in the same conditions invariably act in the same way. But, on the other hand, we see that our fellow-men, like ourselves, possess without exception the power of originating action; and that, if they please,  they act very variously under  the  same  circumstances. Circumstances, including the sum total of conditions and relations, control  the  action  of  all  material  agents,  while  personal  agents control circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) The same is proved by the fact that man is held responsible alike by his own conscience and by God for his own action. This evidently could not be the case if his action were caused by circumstances, and not freely by the man himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>That  the  second  view,  which  supposes  that  a  man  possesses  the power to choose without respect to his judgments or inclinations is not  true;  and  that  the  third  view,  which  supposes  that  a  man possesses the inalienable  faculty  of  choosing  as  upon  the  whole  he judges right or desirable, is true, are proved --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  From  the  consideration  that  while  we  are  conscious,  in  every deliberate act of choice, that we might have chosen otherwise, all the external  conditions  being  the  same,  we  always  feel  that  our  choice was determined  by the sum-total of our views, feelings, and tendencies  at  the  time.  A  man  freely  chooses  what  he  wants  to choose. He would not choose freely if he chose in any other way. But his desire in the premises is determined by his whole intellectual and emotional state at the time.</li>
<li>(2.)  It  is  plain  that  if  the  human  will  decided  in  any  given  case  in opposition  to  all  the  views  of  the  reason  and  all  the  desires  of  the heart,  however  free  the  will  might  be,  the  man  would  be  a  most pitiful slave to a mere irrational and immoral power of willing.</li>
<li>(3.)  All  men  judge that the rational and moral character of any act results  from  the  purpose  or  desire,  the  internal  state  of  mind  or heart, which prompted the act. If the man wills in any given case in opposition  to  all  his  judgments  and  to  all  his  inclinations  of  every kind,  his  act  in  that  case  would  obviously  be  neither  rational  nor moral; and the man himself, in respect to that act, would be neither free nor responsible.</li>
<li>(4.)  If  the  human soul had the power to act thus irrespective  of  its entire interior intellectual and emotional condition at the time, such action could neither be foreseen nor controlled by God, nor influenced by men, and such exercise of volitional power would be absolutely  fortuitous.  It  would  sustain  no  certain  relation  to  the character  of  the  agent.  Christ  taught,  in  opposition  to  this,  that human action is determined by the character of the agent as certainly as the nature of the fruit is determined by the nature of the tree from which it springs; and that the only way to change the character of the action is to change the permanent character or moral tendency and habit of the heart of the agent. Matt. vii. 16 -- 20; xii. 33-35.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section II: Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power to will and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God;[2] but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from it.[3]</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Section III: Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation:[4] so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good,[5] and dead in sin,[6] is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.[7]</p>

</ol>
<p>Section IV: When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin;[8] and,  by  his  grace  alone,  enables  him  freely  to  will  and  to  do  that which  is spiritually good;[9]  yet so, as that by reason  of his remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly, nor only, will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil.[10]</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Section V: The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to good alone, in the state of glory only.[11]</p>
<ol>
<li>Heb. 12:23; I John 3:2; Jude 1:24; Rev. 21:27</li>
</ol>
<p>These  sections  briefly  state  and  contrast  the  various  conditions which  characterize  the  free  agency  of  man  in  his  four  different estates  of  innocency,  hereditary  sin,  grace,  and  glory.  In  all  these estates  man  is  unchangeably  a  free,  responsible  agent,  and  in  all cases  choosing  or  refusing  as,  upon  the  whole,  he  prefers  to  do.  A man's volition is as his desires are in the given case. His desires in any  given  case  are  as  they  are  determined  to  be  by  the  general  or permanent tastes, tendencies, and habitudes of his character. He is responsible  for  his  desires,  because  they  are  determined  by  the nature and permanent  characteristics of his own  soul. He  is responsible for these, because they are the tendencies and qualities of  his  own  nature.  If  these  are  immoral,  he  and  his  actions  are immoral. If these are holy, he and his actions are holy.</p>
<p>When we say that man is a free agent, we mean (1.) That he has the power of originating action; that he is self-moved, and does not only move as he is moved upon from without. (2.) That he always wills that  which,  upon  the  whole  view  of  the  case  presented  by  his understanding  at  the  time,  he  desires  to  will.  (3.)  That  man  is furnished with a reason to distinguish between the true and the false, and a conscience to distinguish between the right and the wrong, in order that his desires and consequent volitions may be both rational and righteous; and yet his desires are not necessarily either rational or  righteous,  but  they  are  formed  under  the  light  of  reason  and conscience, either conformable or contrary to them, according to the permanent habitual disposition or moral character of the soul itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Adam in his estate of innocency was a free agent, created with holy affections and moral tendencies; yet with a character as yet unconfirmed,  capable  of  obedience,  yet  liable  to  be  seduced.  by external temptation, and by the inordinate excitement of the propensions of his animal nature, such as in their proper degree and due  subordination  are  innocent.  Of  this  state  of  a  holy  yet  fallible nature  we  have  no  experience,  and  consequently  very  imperfect comprehension.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to man's present estate, our Standards teach -- (1.) That man is still a free agent, and able to will as upon the whole he desires to will. (2.)  That  he  has  likewise  ability  to  discharge  many  of  the  natural obligations which spring out of his relations to his fellow-men. (3.) That  his  soul  by  reason  of  the  fall  being  morally  corrupted  and spiritually  dead,  his  understanding  being  spiritually  blind,  and  his affections  perverted,  he  is  "utterly  indisposed,  disabled,  and  made opposite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil " (Conf. Faith, ch. vi.,  section  4,  and  ch.  xvi.,  section  3;  L.  Cat.,  q.  25);  and  hence  he "hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation;" so that he "is not able, by his own strength, to  convert  himself,"  or  even  "  to  prepare  himself  thereunto."  Conf. Faith, ch. ix., section 8. The same view is taught in all the Protestant Confessions, Lutheran and Reformed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thirty-nine  Articles  of  the  Church  of  England,  Art.  10:  "  The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God: wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will."</p>
<p>Articles of Synod of Dort, chap. iii., Art. 3: "All men are conceived in sin,  and  born  children  of  wrath,  indisposed  to  all  saving  good, propense to evil, dead in sins and the slaves of sin; and without the grace of the regenerating Holy Spirit they are neither willing nor able to  return  to  God,  to  correct  their  depraved  nature,  or  to  dispose themselves to the correction of it."</p>
<p>Form of Concord, p. 579, Hase's Collection (Lutheran): " Therefore we believe that as it is impossible for a dead body to revive itself, or to communicate  animal  life  to  itself,  in  the  same  degree  is  it impossible  for  a  man,  spiritually  dead  by  reason  of  sin,  to  recall spiritual life within himself." lb. p. 653: "We believe that neither the intellect, heart, nor will of the unregenerate man, is able of its own natural strength either to understand, believe, embrace, will, begin, perfect, perform, operate, or cooperate anything, in things divine and spiritual; but man is so far dead and corrupt in respect to good, that in the nature of man since the fall, and before regeneration, there is not  even  a  scintilla  of  spiritual  strength  remaining  whereby  he  can prepare himself for the grace of God, or apprehend that grace when offered, or is able in whole or in half, or in the least part, to apply or accommodate  himself  to  that  grace,  or  to  confer  or  to  act,  or  to operate or to co-operate anything for his own conversion."</p>
<p>By liberty we mean the inalienable prerogative of the human soul of exercising volition as it pleases. In this sense man is as free now as before  the  fall.  By  ability  we  mean  the  capacity  either  to  will  in opposition to the desires and affections of the soul at the time, or by a bare exercise of volition to make oneself desire and love that which one does not spontaneously desire or love. We affirm that liberty is, and that ability in this sense is not, an element of the constitution of the  soul.  A  man  always  wills  as  upon  the  whole  he  pleases,  but  he cannot will  himself  to  please  differently  from  what  he  does  please.</p>
<p>The moral condition of the heart determines the act of the will, but the act of the will cannot change the moral condition of the heart.</p>
<p>This inability is -- (1.) Absolute. Man has no power, direct or indirect, to fulfill the moral law, or to accept Christ, or to change his nature so as  to  increase  his  power;  and  so  can  neither  do  his  duty  without grace,  nor  prepare  himself  by  himself  for  grace.  (2.)  It  is  purely moral, because man possesses since the fall as much as before all the constitutional  faculties  requisite  to  moral  agency,  and  his  inability has its ground solely in the wrong moral state of those faculties. It is simply  the  evil  moral  disposition  of  the  soul.  (3.)  It  is  natural, because it is not accidental, but innate and inheres in the universal and radical moral state of our souls by nature; that is, as that nature is  naturally  propagated  since  the  fall.  (4.)  It  is  not  natural  in  the sense of belonging to the nature of man as originally formed by God, or as resulting from any constitutional deficiency, or development of our natural moral faculties as originally given by God.</p>
<p>That this doctrine is true is proved -- (1.) From direct declarations of Scripture:  "Can  the  Ethiopian  change  his  skin,  or  the  leopard  his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Jer. xiii. 23. "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him......No man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of  my  Father."  John  vi.  44,  65;  Rom.  ix.  16;  1  Cor.  ii.  14.  (2.) From what the Scriptures say of man's state by nature. It is declared to be a state of " blindness " and "darkness " and of " spiritual death." Eph. iv. 18; Col. ii. 13. The unregenerate are the "servants of sin" and "subject to Satan." Rom. vi. 16, 20; 2 Tim ii. 26; Matt. xii. 33 -- 36. (3.) From what the Scriptures say of the nature and the universal and absolute necessity of regeneration: " Except a man be born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven." John iii. 3. It is called a new birth, a new creation, a begetting anew, a giving a new heart. John iii. 3, 7; Eph. ii. 10; 1 John v. 18; Ezek. xxxvi. 26. In this work God is the agent, man is the subject. It is so great that it requires the "mighty power" of God. Eph. i. 18 -- 20. All Christian duties are declared to be " the fruits of the Spirit." Gal. v. 22, 23. (4.) From the experience of every true Christian. (5.) From the consciousness of every convinced sinner. The great burden of all true conviction is not chiefly the sins committed, but the sinful deadness of heart and aversion to divine things, which is the root of actual transgression, and which remains immovable in spite of all we do. (6.) From the universal experience of the human race. If any man has ever naturally possessed ability to perform  his  spiritual  duties,  it  is  certain  that  no  one  has  ever exercised it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As to the estate into which the regenerate are introduced by grace, our  Standards  affirm  --  (1.)  The  regenerated  Christian  remains,  as before, a free agent, willing always as upon the whole he desires to will.  (2.)  In  the  act  of  regeneration the Holy Spirit has implanted a new  spiritual  principle,  habit,  or  tendency  in  the  affections  of  the soul,  which,  being  subsequently  nourished  and  directed  by  the indwelling Spirit, frees the man from his natural bondage under sin, and enables him prevailingly to will  freely  that  which  is  spiritually good.  And  yet,  because  of  the  lingering  remains  of  his  old  corrupt moral habit of soul, there remains a conflict of tendencies, so that the Christian does not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth also  will  that  which  is  evil.  These  points  will  be  discussed  under chapters x. and xiii.</p>

<p>As to the estate of glorified men in heaven, our Confession teaches that they continue, as before, free agents, but that, all the remains of their old corrupt moral tendencies being extirpated for ever, and the gracious dispositions implanted in regeneration being perfected, and the whole man being brought to the measure of the stature of perfect manhood in the likeness of Christ's glorified humanity, they remain for  ever  perfectly  free  and  immutably  disposed  to  perfect  holiness. Adam  was  holy  and  unstable.  Unregenerate  men  are  unholy  and stable; that is, fixed in unholiness.  Regenerate  men  have  two opposite moral tendencies contesting for empire in their hearts. They are cast about between them, yet the tendency graciously implanted gradually  in  the  end  perfectly  prevails.  Glorified  men  are  holy  and stable. All are free, and therefore responsible.</p>

<p>THERE is  an  outward  call  of  God's  Word,  extended  to  all  men  to whom the gospel is preached, which is considered under the fourth section  of  this  chapter.  The  first  and  second  sections  treat  of  the internal effectual call of God's Spirit, which effects regeneration, and which  is  experienced  only  by  the  elect.  Of  this  internal  call  it  is affirmed: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  there  is  such  an  internal  call,  and  that  it  is  necessary  to salvation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to the subjects of it, that they embrace all the elect, and only the elect.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  the  agent  of  it  --  (1.)  That  the  sole  agent  of  it  is  the  Holy Ghost,  who  uses  (2.)  The  revealed  truth  of  the  gospel  as  his instrument;  (3.)  That  the  subjects  of  it,  while  they  have  freely resisted all those common influences of the Holy Ghost which they have  experienced  before  regeneration,  are  entirely  passive  with respect to that special act of the Spirit it whereby  they are regenerated; nevertheless, in consequence of the change wrought in them in regeneration, they obey the call, and subsequently more or less perfectly co-operate with grace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  the  nature  of  it,  it  is  taught  that  it  is  an  exercise  of  the almighty and effectual power of the Holy Ghost acting immediately upon  the  soul  of  the  subject,  determining  him  and  effectually drawing, yet in a manner perfectly congruous to his nature, so that he comes most freely, being made willing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  the  effect  of  it,  it  is  taught  that  it  works  a  radical  and permanent  change  in  the entire moral  nature of the subject, spiritually enlightening his mind, sanctifying his affections, renewing his will, and giving a new direction to his action.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That there is such an, internal call of the Spirit, distinct from the external  call  of  the  Word,  and  that  it  is  necessary  to  salvation,  are proved --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) from what the Scriptures teach concerning man's state by nature as  a  state  of  spiritual  death,  blindness,  insensibility,  and  absolute inability  with  respect  to  all  action  spiritually  good,  as  has  been sufficiently shown under chapter ix., section 8.</li>
<li>(2.)  The  Scriptures  distinguish  between  the  Spirit's  influence  and that of the Word alone. 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15; iii. 6; 1 Thess. i. 5, 6.</li>
<li>(3.) A spiritual influence is declared to be necessary to dispose and enable men to receive the truth. John vi. 45; Acts xvi. 14; Eph. i. 17.</li>
<li>(4.) All that is good in man is referred to God as its author. Eph. ii. 8; Phil. ii. 13; 2Tim. ii. 25; Heb. xiii. 21.</li>
<li>(5.) The working of the Spirit upon the hearts of the regenerated is represented as far more direct, powerful, and efficient, than the mere moral influence of the truth upon the understanding and affections. Eph. i. 19; iii. 7.</li>
<li>(6.)  The  result  effected  in  regeneration  is  different  from  an  effect proper to the simple truth. It is "a new birth," "a new creation," etc. John iii. 3, 7; Eph. iv. 24.</li>
<li>(7.) The Scriptures explicitly distinguish between the two calls. Of the subjects of the one it is said, "Many are called, but few are chosen." Matt. xxii. 14. Of the subjects of the other it is said, "Whom he called, them he also justified." Rom. viii. 30. Comp. Prov. i. 24, and John vi. 45.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these arguments conspire to prove that this spiritual influence is essential to salvation. Whatever  is the necessary condition of regeneration is the necessary condition of salvation, because "except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." John iii. 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this spiritual call embraces all the elect, and only the elect, is proved -- (1.)  From what has been already proved, (a.)  Chapter  iii. sections 3 --5, that God has from eternity definitely and unchangeably determined who shall be saved; and (b.) Chapter iii., section 6, that God, having "appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto." Effectual calling being the actual saving of a soul from the death of sin by the mighty power of God, it is obvious that it must be applied to all who are to be saved, and that it cannot be applied to any who are not to be saved. (2.) The same is proved from the fact that the Scriptures represent the "called" as the "elect," and the " elect" as the "called." Rom. viii. 28, 30. Those with Christ in heaven  are  "called,  elect,  and  faithful."  Rev.  xvii. 14. (3.) The Scriptures, moreover, declare that the " calling" is based upon the " election:" "who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." 2 Tim. i. 9; 2 Thess. ii. 13, 14; Rom. xi. 7.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the sole agent in this effectual calling is the Holy Ghost; that he uses Gospel truth as his instrument; and that, while all sinners are active in resisting the common influences of grace before regeneration, and all believers in co-operating with sanctifying grace after  regeneration,  nevertheless  every  new-created  soul  is  passive with  respect  to  that  divine  act  of  the  Holy  Spirit  whereby  he  is regenerated, may all be proved under the following distinct heads: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) There are certain influences of the Spirit in the present life which extend to all men in a greater or less degree; which tend to restrain or to persuade the soul; which are exerted in the way of heightening the  natural  moral  effect  of  the  truth  upon  the  understanding,  the heart, and the conscience. They involve no change of principle and permanent disposition, but only an increase of the natural emotions of  the  heart  in  view  of  sin,  of  duty,  and  of  self-interest.  These influences, of course, may be resisted, and are habitually resisted, by the unregenerate. The fact that such resistible influences are</li>
</ul>
<p>experienced by men is proved -- (a.) From the fact that the Scriptures affirm  that  they  are  resisted.  Gen.  vi.  3;  Heb.  x.  29.  (b.)  Every Christian  is  conscious  that  anterior  to  his  conversion  he  was  the subject of influences impressing him with serious thoughts, convincing  him  of  sin,  tending  to  draw  him  to  the  obedience  of Christ,  which  he  for  the  time  resisted.  We  observe  the  same  to  be true of many men who are never truly converted at all.</p>
<p>(2.) The distinction between regeneration and conversion is obvious and necessary. Under chapter ix. we saw that the voluntary acts of the human soul are determined by, and derive their character from, the  affections  and  desires  which  prompt  them;  and  that  these affections  and  desires  derive  their  character  from  the  permanent moral state of the soul in which they arise. In the unregenerate this permanent moral state and disposition of the soul is evil, and hence the action is evil.  Action positively holy is impossible except as the consequence of a positively holy disposition. The infusion of such a disposition must therefore precede any act of true spiritual obedience. Effectual calling, according to the usage of our Standards, is  the  act  of  the  Holy  Spirit  effecting  regeneration.  Regeneration  is the effect produced by the Holy Spirit in effectual calling. The Holy Spirit,  in  the  act  of  effectual  calling,  causes  the  soul  to  become regenerate  by  implanting  a  new  governing  principle  or  habit  of spiritual affection and action. The soul itself, in conversion, immediately acts under the guidance of this new principle in turning from sin unto God through Christ. It is evident that the implantation of the  gracious  principle  is  different  from  the  exercise  of  that principle,  and  that  the  making  a  man  willing  is  different  from  his acting willingly. The first is the act of God solely; the second is the consequent act of man, dependent upon the continued assistance of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>That  God  is  the  sole  agent  in  the  act  which  effects  regeneration  is plain -- (a.) From the nature of the case, as shown above. The making an  unwilling  man  willing  cannot  be  co-operated  with  by  the  man while  unwilling.  (b.)  From  what  was  proved  under  chapter  ix., section  3,  as  to  man's  absolute  inability  with  respect  to  spiritual things.  (c.)  From  what  the  Scriptures  say  as  to  the  nature  of  the change. They call it "a new birth," " a begetting," "a quickening," "a new creation." "God begetteth, the Spirit quickeneth;" " We are born again," " We are God's workmanship." John iii. 3, 5 -- 7; 1John v. 18; Eph. ii. 1, 5, 10. See also Ezek. xi. 19; Ps. li. 10; Eph iv. 23; Heb. viii. 10.  That,  after  regeneration,  the  new-born  soul  at  once  begins  and ever continues more or less perfectly to co-operate with sanctifying grace,  is  self-evident.  Faith,  repentance,  love,  good  works,  are  one and all at the same time "fruits of the Spirit" and free actions of men. We are continually conscious, moreover, that we are subject to divine influences, which we are either  resisting  or  obeying,  and  which  we are  free  to  resist  or  obey  as  we  please,  while  through  grace  we  do prevailingly please to obey.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3.)  That  the  Holy  Spirit  uses  the  "truth"  as  his  instrument  in effectual  calling  is  plain  --  (a.)  Because  he  never  acts  in  this  way where the knowledge of the truth  is  entirely  wanting;  (b.)  Because the Scriptures assert that we are begotten by the truth, sanctified by the truth, grow by it, etc. John xvii. 19; James i. 18; 1 Pet. ii. 2.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  this  divine  action  is  in  its  nature  at  once  omnipotent  and certainly efficacious, and yet perfectly congruous to the rational and voluntary nature of man, follows certainly from the fact that it is the act of the  all-wise  and  all-powerful  God  in  executing  his  selfconsistent  and immutable  decrees.  What  God  does  directly  to accomplish his own changeless purposes must be certainly efficacious and powerful. Eph. i. 18, 19. Besides, the very thing done is  to  make  us  willing,  to  work  faith  in  us;  and  that  is  indubitably connected  with  salvation.  Phil.  ii.  13.  That  it  is  effectual  is  also asserted. Eph. iii. 7, 20; iv. 16.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That  this  Divine  influence  is  perfectly  congruous  to  our  nature  is plain  --  (1.)  From  the  fact  that  it  is  the  influence  of  an  all-wise Creator upon the work of his own hand. It is not conceivable either that  God  is  unable  or  indisposed  to  control  the  actions  of  his creatures in a manner perfectly consistent with their nature. (2.) The influence he exerts is called in Scripture " a drawing," "a teaching," "an enlightening," etc. John vi. 44, 45; Eph. i. 18. (3.) By nature the mind is darkened and the affections perverted and the will enslaved by sin. Regeneration restores these faculties to their proper condition. It cannot be inconsistent with a rational nature to let in the  light,  nor  to  a  free  will  to  deliver  it  from  bondage.  "Where  the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." 2 Cor. iii. 17; Phil. ii. 13; Ps. cx. 3. Every regenerated man is conscious -- (a.) That no constraint has been laid upon the spontaneous movement of his faculties; and (b.) That, on the other hand, none of his faculties ever acted so freely and consistently with the law of their nature before.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this change is radical is proved from the fact that, as shown above, it consists in the implantation of a new governing principle of life; from the fact that it is a "new birth," a "new creation," wrought by  the  mighty  power  of  God  in  execution  of  his  eternal  purpose  of salvation; and that it is as necessary for the most moral and amiable as for the morally abandoned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That this change is permanent will be shown under chapter xvii., on the Perseverance of the Saints.</p>
<p>That  it  affects  the  entire  man  --  intellect,  affections,  and  will  --  is evident  --  (1.)  From  the  essential  unity  of  the  soul.  It  is  the  one indivisible "I" which thinks, feels, and wills. If the permanent moral state of the soul is corrupt, all its functions must be perverted.  We can have no desire for an object unless we perceive its loveliness; nor can we perceive intellectually the loveliness of that which is wholly uncongenial to our inherent tastes and dispositions. (2.) The Scriptures  expressly  affirm  that  sin  is  essentially  deceiving,  that innate depravity involves moral blindness, and that the natural man cannot receive the tidings which are spiritually discerned. 1 Cor. ii. 14; 2 Cor. iv. 4; John xvi. 3. (3.) The Scriptures expressly affirm that all the "new-born" are the subjects of a spiritual illumination of the understanding  as  well  as  renewal  of  the  affections.  John  xvii.  3;  1</p>
<p>Cor. ii. 12, 13; 2 Cor. iv. 6; Eph. i. 18; 1 John iv. 7; v. 20. (4.) In the Bible  the  phrase  "  to  give  a  new  heart"  is  equivalent  to  effect regeneration; and the phrase "heart" is characteristically used for the entire  interior  man  --  intellect,  affections,  and,  will.  Observe  such phrases as "counsels of the heart," 1 Cor. iv. 5; "imaginations of the heart," Luke i. 51; "thoughts and intents of the heart," Heb. iv. 12.</p>
<p>Section  III.  Elect  infants,  dying  in  infancy,  are  regenerated,  and saved  by  Christ,  through  the  Spirit,[12]  who  worketh  when,  and where, and how he pleaseth:[13] so also are all other elect persons who are incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the Word.[14]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gen. 17:7; Luke 1:15; 18:15-16; Acts 2:39; John 3:3, 5; I John 5:12</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John 3:8 14. John 16:7-8; I John 5:12; Acts 4:12</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The  outward  call  of  God's  Word,  and  all  the  "means  of  grace" provided in the present dispensation, of course presuppose intelligence  upon  the  part  of  those  who  receive  them.  The  will  of God,  also,  is  revealed  only  as  far  as  it  concerns  those  capable  of understanding  and  profiting  by  the  revelation.  His  purposes  with respect  to  either  persons  or  classes  not  thus  addressed  are  not explicitly revealed.</p>
<p>If infants and others not capable of being called by the gospel are to be  saved,  they  must  be  regenerated  and  sanctified  immediately  by God  without  the  use  of  means.  If  God  could  create  Adam  holy without means, and if he can new-create believers in righteousness and true holiness by the use of means which a large part of men use without profit, he can certainly make infants and others regenerate without means. Indeed, the natural depravity of infants lies  before moral action, in the judicial deprivation of the Holy Ghost. The evil is rectified  at  that  stage,  therefore,  by  the  gracious  restoration  of  the soul  to  its  moral  relation  to  the  Spirit  of  God.  The  phrase  "elect infants" is precise and fit for its purpose. It is not intended to suggest that there are any infants not elect, but simply to point out the facts -  (1.)  That  all  infants  are  born  under  righteous  condemnation;  and (2.) That no infant has any claim in itself to salvation; and hence (3.) The salvation of each infant, precisely as the salvation of every adult, must have its absolute ground in the sovereign election of God. This would be just as true if all adults were elected, as it is now that only some adults  are  elected.  It  is,  therefore,  just  as  true,  although  we have  good  reason  to believe that all infants are elected. The Confession adheres in this place accurately to the facts revealed. It is certainly revealed that none, either adult or infant, is saved except on the  ground  of  a  sovereign  election;  that  is,  all  salvation  for  the human race is pure grace. It is not positively revealed that all infants are  elect,  but  we  are  left,  for  many  reasons,  to  indulge  a  highly probable hope that such is the fact. The Confession affirms what is certainly revealed, and leaves that which revelation has not decided to remain, without the suggestion of a positive opinion upon one side or the other.</p>
<p>Section IV. Others, not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the Word,[15] and may have some common operations of the Spirit,[16] yet they never truly come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved:[17] much less can men, not professing the Christian religion, be saved in any other way whatsoever,[17] be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature, and the laws of that religion they do profess.[18] And, to assert and maintain that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested.[19]</p>
<ol>
<li>Matt. 13:14-15; 22:14; Acts 13:48; 28:24 16. Matt. 7:22; 13:20, 21; Heb. 6:4-5 17. John 6:37, 64-66; 8:44; 13:18; cf. 17:12 18. Acts 4:12; I John 4:2-3; II John 1:9; John 4:22; 14:6; 17:3; Eph. 2:12-13; Rom. 10:13-17 19. II John 1:9-12; I Cor. 16:22; Gal. 1:6-8</li>
</ol>
<p>This section, taken in connection with the parallel passage in L. Cat., q. 60, teaches the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the non-elect will certainly fail of salvation, not because a free salvation  is  not  made  available  to  them  if  they  accept  Christ,  but because they never accept Christ; and they all refuse to accept him, because, although they may be persuaded by some of the common influences of the Holy Ghost, their radical aversion to God is never overcome  by  effectual  calling.  It  has  already  been  proved  under sections 1 and 2 that the grace of effectual calling extends to all the elect,  and  only  to  the  elect;  hence  the  truth  of  this  proposition follows.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the diligent profession and honest practice of neither natural religion, nor of any other religion than pure Christianity, can in the least avail to promote the salvation of the soul, is evident from the essential principles of the gospel. If any person perfectly conformed to the amount of spiritual truth known to him in every thought and act  from  birth  upward,  however  little  that  knowledge  might  be,  he would of course need no salvation. But all men, as we have seen, are born  under  condemnation,  and  begin  to  act  as  moral  agents  with natures  already  corrupt.  "All  have  sinned,  and  come  short  of  the glory  of  God."  Rom.  iii.  23.  Hence  it  follows  that  an  atonement  is absolutely  necessary,  and  consequently  a  personal  interest  in  the redemption of Christ is absolutely necessary to salvation; for if a law, conformity  to  which  could  have  given  life,  could  have  been  given, Christ is dead in vain. Gal. ii. 21; iii. 21. To admit that men may be saved irrespectively of Christ is virtually to deny Christ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That in the case of sane adult persons a knowledge of Christ and a voluntary  acceptance  of  him  is  essential  in  order  to  a  personal interest in his salvation is proved --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) Paul argues this point explicitly. If men call upon the Lord they shall be saved; but in order to call upon him, they must believe; and in  order  to  believe,  they  must  hear;  and  that  they  should  hear,  the gospel must be preached unto them. Thus the established order is -salvation cometh by faith, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by</li>
</ul>
<p>the Word of God. Rom, x. 13 -- 17; Matt. xi. 27; John xiv. 6; xvii. 3; Acts iv. 12.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) God has certainly revealed no purpose to save any except those who,  hearing  the  gospel,  obey;  and  he  requires  that  his  people,  as custodians of the gospel, should be diligent in disseminating it as the appointed means of saving souls. Whatever lies beyond this circle of sanctified means is unrevealed, unpromised, uncovenanted.</li>
<li>(3.) The heathen in mass, with no single definite and unquestionable exception  on  record,  are  evidently  strangers  to  God,  --  and  going down to death in an unsaved condition. The presumed possibility of being  saved  without  a  knowledge  of  Christ  remains,  after  eighteen hundred years, a possibility illustrated by no example.</li>

<p>SECTION  1  THOSE  whom  God  effectually  calls  he  also  freely justifies,(1) not by infusing righteousness into them but by pardoning their sins, and  by accounting and  accepting their persons as righteous, not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for  Christ's  sake  alone;  not  by  imputing  faith  itself,  the  act  of believing,  or  any  other  evangelical  obedience,  to  them,  as  their righteousness,  but  by  imputing  the  obedience  and  satisfaction  of Christ  unto  them,(2)  they  receiving  and  resting  on  him  and  his righteousness by faith, which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.(3)</p>
<p>SECTION  2  FAITH,  thus  receiving  and  resting  on  Christ  and  his righteousness is the sole instrument of justification;(4) yet it is  not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.(5)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Rom. 8:30; 3:24. (2) Rom. 4:5-8; 2 Cor. 5:19,21; Rom. 3:22,24,25,27,28;  Titus  3:5,7;  Eph.  1:7;  Jer.  23:6;  1  Cor.  1:30,31; Rom. 5:17-19. (3) Acts 10:44; Gal. 2:16; Phil. 2:9; Acts 13:38,39; Eph. 2:7,8. (4) John 1:12; Rom. 3:28; 5:1. (5) James 2:17,22,26; Gal. 5:6.</li>
</ul>
<p>We come now to the sections which instruct us on the nature and reality of justification.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>All those, aned only those, whom God has effectually called he also freely justifies, that this is so is proven by the following: (1) From the express declarations of Scripture: "Whom he did predestinate, them he  also  called:  and  whom  he  called,  them  he  also  justified."  Rom. 8:30.  (2)  From  the  fact  that  effectual  calling  and  justification  are both necessary in order to salvation, and are both essential steps in the execution by God of his own immutable and infallibly efficacious decree of election. (3) From the fact that only those who truly believe are justified, and only those who are regenerate can truly believe.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to its nature, this justification is a purely judicial act of God as judge,  whereby he pardons all the sins of a believer, and accounts, accepts, and treats him as a person righteous in the eye of the divine law. This includes two subordinate propositions: (1) Justification is a</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>judicial  act  of  God,  whereby  he  declares  us  to  be  conformed  to  the demands of the law as the condition of our life;  it  is  not  an  act  of gracious  power,  making  us  holy  or  conformed  to  the  law  as  a standard of moral character. The Romanists use the term "justification" in a vague and general sense, as including at once the forgiveness  of  sins  and  the  infusion  of  grace.  Socinians,  and  those who  teach  the  moral  influence  theory  of  the  atonement,  regard justification  as  meaning  the  same  as  sanctification;  that  is,  the making a man personally holy. The true sense of Justification, stated above, is, when taken in its connection with faith, the grand central principle of the Reformation, brought out and triumphantly vindicated by Luther. That it is true is proved-</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) From the universal meaning of the English word to justify, and of the equivalent Greek word in the New Testament. They both are alike always used to express an act declaring a man to be square with the demands of law, never to express an act making him holy. (Gal. 2:16; 3:11.)</li>
<li>(b)  In  Scripture,  justification  is  always  set  forth  as  the  opposite  of condemnation. The opposite of "to  sanctify"  is  "to  pollute"  but  the opposite of "to justify" is "to condemn." (Rom. 8:30-34; John 3:18.)</li>
<li>(c) The true sense of the phrase "to justify" is clearly proved by the terms used in Scripture as equivalent to it. For example: "To impute righteousness  without  works";  "To  forgive  iniquities";  "To  cover sins."  (Rom.  4:6-8.)  "Not  to  impute  transgression  unto  them."  (2 Cor. 5:19.) "Not to bring into condemnation." (John 5:24.)</li>
<li>(d) In many passages it would produce the most obvious nonsense to substitute  sanctification  (the  making  holy)  for  justification  (the declaring legally just); as, for instance: "For by the works of the law shall no flesh be sanctified"; or, "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are sanctified by the law; ye are fallen from grace." (Gal. 2:16; 5:4.)</li>
<li>(e)  Justification  and  sanctification  are  set  forth  in  Scripture  as distinct  graces-inseparable,  alike  necessary,  yet  distinct  in  their nature, grounds and ends. 1 Cor. 6:11.</li>
<li>(2) Justification is not mere pardon; it includes pardon of sin, and in addition the declaration that all the claims of law are satisfied with respect to the person justified, and that consequently he has a right to all the immunities and rewards which in the covenant of life are suspended upon perfect conformity to the demands of law. Pardon (a) Relaxes the claims of law, or waives their exaction in a given case.</li>
<li>(b) It is an act of a sovereign in the exercise of pure prerogative. (c) It is free, resting upon considerations of mercy or of public policy. (d) It simply  remits  the  penalty  of  sin;  it  secures  neither  honors  nor rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p>On  the  other  hand,  justification  (a)  Is  the  act  of  a  judge,  not  of  a sovereign.  (b)  It  rests  purely  upon  the  state  of  the  law  and  of  the facts, and is impossible where there is not a perfect righteousness. (c) It pronounces the law not relaxed, but fulfilled in its strictest sense. (d)  It  declares  the  person  justified  to  be  justly  entitled  to  all  the honors  advantages  suspended  upon  perfect  conformity  to  all  the demands of law. The truth of this proposition is proved-</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) From the uniform and obvious meaning of the words "to justify." No one ever confounds the justification of a person with his pardon.</li>
<li>(b)  Justification  rests  upon  the  full  satisfaction  of  divine  justice Christ  has  worked for  the  elect.  It  is  a  judicial  declaration  that  the law is satisfied- not a sovereign waiving of the penalty.</li>
<li>(c)  The  Scriptures  declare  that  our  justification  proceeds  upon  the ground of a perfect righteousness. "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness  to  every  one  that  believeth."  (Rom.  10:3-9;  1  Cor. 1:30.)  The  essence  of  pardon  is  that  a  man  is  forgiven  without righteousness. The essence of Justification is that a man  is pronounced to be possessed of righteousness, which satisfies the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We  are  "made  the  righteousness  of  God  in  him."  (2  Cor.  5:21.) Justification  is  paraphrased  as  "not  imputing  sin";  as  "imputing righteousness without works." (Rom. 4:6-8.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(d) The effects of justification are much more than those of pardon. The  justified  have  "peace  with  God,"  assurance  of  salvation  (Rom. 5:1-10); "inheritance among them which are sanctified" (Acts 26:18).</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Justification  proceeds  upon  the  imputation  or  crediting  to  the believer by God of the righteousness of his great Representative and Surety, Jesus Christ. L. Cat., q. 70: "Justification is an act of God's free  grace  unto  sinners,  in  which  he  pardons  all  their  sins,  accepts and accounts their persons righteous in his sight; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them, and received by faith alone." (Compare also L. Cat., q. 77; and S. Cat., q. 33.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Arminians  hold  that  for  Christ's  sake  the  demands  of  the  law  are graciously lowered, and faith and evangelical obedience accepted in the  place  of  perfect  obedience  as  the  ground  of  justification.  Our Standards and all the Reformed and Lutheran Confessions teach that the  true  ground  of  justification  is  the  perfect  righteousness  (active and passive) of Christ, imputed to the believer, and received by faith alone. S. Cat., q. 33. This is proved-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Because the Scriptures insist everywhere that we are not justified by works. This is affirmed of works in general-of all kinds of works, natural or gracious, without distinction. (Rom. 4:4-8; 11:6.)</li>
<li>(2) Because the Scriptures declare that good works, of whatever kind, instead of being the ground of justification, are possible only as its consequences: "For sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace"; "But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter." (Rom. 6:14; 7:6.)</li>
<li>(3) Because the Scriptures declare that the obedience and sufferingi.e.,  perfect  righteousness  or  fulfillment  of  the  law-by  Christ,  our Representative, is the true ground of Justification: "Therefore, as by the offence of one Judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto  justification  of  life.  For  as  by  one  man's  disobedience  many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (Rom. 5:18,19; 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:9.)</li>
<li>(4) Because the Scriptures affirm that this righteousness is imputed to the believer in the act of justification. The phrase "to impute sin" or "righteousness," in its scriptural usage, signifies simply to set to one's  account,  to  lay  to  one's  charge  or  credit  as  the  ground  of judicial process. Our sins are said to have been laid upon Christ (Isa. 53:6,12; Gal. 3:13; Heb. 9:28; 1 Pet. 2:24), because their guilt was so charged to his account that they were justly punished in him. In like manner Christ's righteousness is imputed, or its rewardableness is so credited to the believer that all the covenanted honors and rewards of  a  perfect  righteousness  henceforth  rightly  belong  to  him.  (Rom. 4:4-8;  2  Cor.  5:19-21.)  For  the  usage  of  the  Hebrew  and  Greek equivalents of "imputation" (see Gen. 31:15; Lev. 7:18; Num. 18:2730; Mark 15:28; Luke 22:37; Rom. 2:26; 4:3-9; 2 Cor. 5:19).</li>
</ul>
<p>This doctrine of our Standards is that of the whole Protestant body of the Reformed and Lutheran Churches.</p>
<p>Calvin says in his Institutes, b. 3., ch. 11., s. 2: "A man will be justified by faith when, excluded from the righteousness of works, he by faith lays hold of the righteousness of Christ, and, clothed in it, appears in the sight of God, not as a sinner, but as righteous." The Heidelberg Cat., q. 60: "How art thou justified in the sight of God? Only by a true faith in Jesus Christ; so that, though my conscience accuse me that I have grossly  transgressed  all  the  commandments  of  God,  and  kept none of them, and am still inclined to all evil, notwithstanding, God, without  any  merit  of  mine,  but  only  of  mere  grace,  grants  and imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ."</p>
<p>Lutheran Form. of Concord: "That righteousness which before God is of mere grace imputed to faith, or to the believer, is the obedience, suffering,  and  resurrection  of  Christ,  by  which  he  for  our  sakes satisfied  the  law  and  expiated  our  sins.  .  .  .  On  which  account  his obedience . . . is imputed to us; so that God, on account of that whole obedience . . . remits our sins, reputes us as good and just, and gives us eternal salvation."</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  essential  and  sole  condition  upon  which  this  gracious imputation of the righteousness of Christ to the believer proceeds is, that he exercises faith in or on Christ as his righteousness, or ground of acceptance and justification. Faith is here called the "condition" of justification, because  it  is  an  essential  requisite,  and  necessary instrument  whereby  the  soul, always treated as a free agent, appropriates the righteousness of Christ, which is the legal ground of justification. That faith in or on Christ, and no other grace, is always represented  in  Scripture  as  the  necessary  instrument  or  means  of justification, is proved, (Gal. 2:16; Rom. 4:9; Acts 16:31.) That faith is the  instrument  whereby  the  soul  apprehends  the  true  ground  of justification  in  the  righteousness  of  Christ,  and  is  not  itself,  as Arminians pretend, that ground, is proved-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1) Because, as above shown, the vicarious obedience and suffering of Christ is that ground.</li>
<li>(2)  Because faith is  "a  work,"  and  Paul  asserts  that  justification  on the ground of works is impossible. (Rom. 3:20-28; Gal. 2:16.)</li>
<li>(3) Because faith in or on Christ evidently rests upon that which is without  itself,  and  from  its  very  nature  is  incapable  of  laying  the foundation for a legal justification.</li>
<li>(4)  Because  the  Scriptures  constantly  affirm  that  we  are  justified "through"or  by  means  of  faith,  but  never  on  account  of  or  for  the</li>
</ul>
<p>sake of faith. Rom. 5:1; Gal. 2:16.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  faith  itself  is  not  our  own,  but  a  gracious  gift  of  God.  (Eph. 2:7,8; Acts 14:27.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>While it is faith alone, unassociated with any other grace, which is the  sole  instrument  of  justification,  yet  it  is  never  alone  in  the justified  person,  but  when  genuine  is  always  accompanied  with  all other  Christian  graces.  To  our  doctrine  of  justification  the  famous passage  in  James  2:14  is  often  objected.  But  Paul  and  James  are speaking  of  different  things.  Paul  teaches  that  faith  alone  justifies. He is arguing against Pharisees and legalists. James teaches that a faith which is alone-that is, a dead faith-will not justify. He is arguing against nominal Christians, who would hold the truth in unrighteousness. Paul uses the word "justify" in the sense  of  God's justification of the sinner; to which  faith, and not works, is prerequisite. James uses the word to "justify" in the sense of prove true,  or  real;  in  which  sense  faith  is  justified  or  proved  genuine  by works. Consequently, orthodox theologians have always acknowledged that while faith alone justifies, a faith which is alone, or  unassociated  with  other  graces  and  fruitless  in  good  works,  will not justify.  "Works," says Luther, "are not taken into consideration when the question respects justification. But true faith will no more fail to produce them than the sun can cease to give light."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 3 CHRIST, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real,  and  full  satisfaction,  to  his  Father's  justice  in  their  behalf.(6) Yet,  inasmuch  as  he  was  given  by  the  Father  for  them,(7)  and  his obedience and satisfaction in their stead,(8) and both freely, not for anything in them, their justification is only of free grace;(9) that both the  exact  justice  and  rich  grace  of  God  might  be  glorified  in  the justification of sinners.(10)</p>
<ul>
<li>(6)  Rom. 5:8-10,19; 1 Tim. 2:5,6; Heb. 10:10,14; Dan.  9:24,26;  Isa. 53:4-6, 10-12. (7) Rom. 8:32. (8) 2 Cor. 5:21; Matt. 3:17; Eph. 5:2. (9)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7. (10) Rom. 3:26; Eph. 2:7.</p>
<p>The  first truth asserted  in this section  is, that Christ, by  his obedience  and  death,  has  fully  paid  the  debt  of  those  who  are Justified;  and  that  he  made  for  them  a  proper,  real,  and  full satisfaction to his Father's justice. In connection with the above, the second  truth  that  is  taught  here  is,  that  this  justification  is,  as  it respects the persons justified,  from  beginning to end a stupendous manifestation of the free grace of God.</p>
<p>The fact that Christ's righteousness is the ground of justification, and that his righteousness in strict rigor fully satisfies all the demands of the divine law, instead of being inconsistent with the perfect freedom and  graciousness  of  justification,  vastly  enhances  its  grace.  It  is evident that God must either sacrifice his law, his elect, or his Son (Gal. 2:21; 3:21). It is no less plain that it is a far greater expression of  love  and  free  grace  to  save  the  elect  at  the  expense  of  such  a sacrifice  than  it  would  be  to  save  them  either  at  the  sacrifice  of principle or in case no sacrifice of any kind was needed. The cross of Christ  is  the  focus  in  which  the  most  intense  rays  alike  of  divine grace and justice meet together, in which they are perfectly reconciled. This is the highest reach of justice, and at the same time and for the same reason the highest reach of grace the universe can ever  see.  The  self-assumption  of  the  penalty  upon  the  part  of  the eternal  Son  of  God  is  the  highest  conceivable  vindication  of  the absolute  inviolability  of  justice,  and  at  the  same  time  the  highest conceivable  expression  of  infinite  love.  Justice  is  vindicated  in  the vicarious  suffering  of  the  very  penalty  in  strict  rigor.  Free  grace  is manifested-(1)  In  the  admittance  of  a  vicarious  sufferer.  (2)  In  the gift  of  God's  beloved  Son  for  that  service.  (3)  In  the  sovereign election of the persons to be represented by him. (4) In the glorious rewards which accrue to them on condition of that representation.</p>
<p>SECTION 4 GOD did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect; (11) and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification.(12) Nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit in due time actually applies Christ unto them. (13)</p>
<p>(11) Gal. 3:8; 1 Pet. 1:2,19,20; Rom. 8:30. (12) Gal. 4:4; 1 Tim. 2:6; Rom. 4:25. (13) Col. 1:21,22; Gal. 2:16; Titus 3:4-7.</p>
<p>It has been objected to our doctrine by some Arminians, and held as a part of it by some Antinomians, that if Christ literally paid the debt of  his  elect  in  his  obedience  and  suffering  when  on  earth,  it  must follow that the elect have been justified from the moment that debt was  paid.  The  Scriptures,  on  the  contrary,  as  well  as  all  Christian experience, make it certain that no one is justified until the moment that God gives him saving faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ paid the penal, not the money debt of his people. It is a matter of  free  grace  that  his  substitution  was  admitted.  The  satisfaction, therefore, does not liberate ipso facto , like the payment of a money debt, but sets the real criminal free only on such conditions and at such times  as  had  been  previously  agreed  upon  between  God,  the gracious sovereign, on the one hand, and Christ, their representative and  substitute,  on  the  other  hand.  Christ  died  for  his  people  in execution of a covenant between himself and his Father, entered into in eternity. The effects of his death, therefore, eventuate precisely as and when it is provided in the covenant that it should do so.</p>
<p>SECTION  5  GOD  continues  to  forgive  the  sins  of  those  who  are justified;(14)  and  although  they  can  never  fall  from  the  state  of justification,(15) yet they may by their sins fall under God's fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.(16)</p>
<p>(14)  Matt.  6:12;  1  John  1:7,9;  2:1,2.  (15)  Luke  22:32;  John  10:28; Heb.  10:14.  (16)  Ps.  89:31-33;  51:7-12;  32:5;  Matt.  26:75;  1  Cor. 11:30,32; Luke 1:20.</p>
<p>This section teaches that justification changes radically and permanently the relation which the subject of it sustains both to God and to the demands of the divine law viewed as a condition of favor. Before justification, God is an angry judge, holding the sentence of the condemning law for a season in suspense.</p>
<p>After  justification,  the  law  instead  of  condemning  acquits,  and demands that the subject be regarded and treated like  a  son,  as  is provided  in  the  eternal  covenant;  and  God,  as  a  loving  Father, proceeds  to  execute  all  the  kind  offices  which  belong  to  the  new relation. This requires, of course, discipline and correction, as well as instruction  and  consolation.  All  suffering  is  either  mere  calamity, when viewed aside from all intentional relation to human character; or penalty, when designed to satisfy justice for sin; or chastisement, when designed to correct and improve the offender. Irrespective of the economy  of  redemption,  all suffering is to the reprobate installments of the eternal penalty. After justification, all suffering to the justified, of whatever kind, is fatherly chastisement, designed to correct their faults  and  improve their graces. And as they came, in the first instance, to God in the exercise of repentance and faith in Christ,  so  must  they  always  continue  to  return  to  him  after  every partial wandering and loss of his sensible favor in the exercise of the same repentance and faith; and thus only can they hope to have his pardon sensibly renewed to them. Examine the proof-texts appended above to the text of this section of the Confession.</p>
<p>SECTION 6 THE justification of believers under the Old Testament was, in all these respects, one and the same with the justification of believers under the New Testament.(17)</p>
<p>(17) Gal. 3:9,13,14; Rom. 4:22-24; Heb. 13:8.</p>
<p>The truth taught in this section has already been fully proved above, under chapter 7., ss. 4-6; and chapter 8., s. 6.</p>

<p>All  those  that  are  justified,  god  vouchsafes,  in  and  for  his  only  son jesus christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption,(1) by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of god;(2) have his name put upon them,(3) receive the  spirit  of  adoption;(4)  have  access  to  the  throne  of  grace  with boldness;(5) are enabled  to cry, abba, father;(6) are pitied,(7) protected,(8) provided for,(9) and chastened by him as by a father; (10) yet never cast off,(11) but sealed to the day of redemption,(12) and inherit the promises,(13) as heirs of everlasting salvation.(14)</p>
<p>(1) Eph. 1:5; Gal. 4:4,5. (2) Rom. 8:17; John 1:12. (3) Jer. 14:9; 2 Cor. 6:18; Rev. 3:12. (4) Rom. 8:15. (5) Eph. 3:12; Rom. 5:2. (6) Gal. 4:6. (7) Ps. 103:13. (8) Prov. 14:26. (9) Matt. 6:30,32; 1 Pet. 5:7. (10) Heb. 12:6. (11) Lam. 3:31. (12) Eph. 4:30. (13) Heb. 6:12. (14) 1 Pet. 1:3,4; Heb. 1:14.</p>
<p>The instant a believer is united to Christ in the exercise of faith, there is  accomplished in him simultaneously and inseparably two things: (1) A total change of relation to God, and to the law as a covenant of life;  and (2) A change of his inward spiritual nature. The change of relation  is represented  by  justification-the  change  of  nature  by regeneration.  REGENERATION  is  an  act  of  God,  originating,  by  a new creation, a new spiritual life in the heart of the subject. The first and instant act of that new creature, consequent upon his regeneration,  is  FAITH,  or  a  believing,  trusting  embrace  of  the person  and  work  of  Christ.  Upon  the  exercise  of  faith  by  the regenerated soul, JUSTIFICATION is the instant act of God, on the ground  of  that  perfect  righteousness  which  the  sinner's  faith  has apprehended, declaring him to be free from all condemnation, and to have  a  legal  right  to  the  relations  and  benefits  secured  by  the covenant which Christ has fulfilled in his behalf. SANCTIFICATION is the progressive growth toward the perfect maturity of that new life which was implanted in regeneration. ADOPTION presents the new creature in his new relations-his new relations entered upon with a congenial  heart,  and  his  new  life  developing  in  a  congenial  home, and  surrounded  with  those  relations  which  foster  its  growth  and crown  it  with  blessedness.  Justification  effects  only  a  change  of relations. Regeneration and sanctification effect only inherent moral and spiritual states of soul. Adoption includes both. As set forth in Scripture,  it  embraces  in  one  complex  view  the  newly-regenerated creature  in the new  relations  into which  he  is introduced  by justification.</p>
<p>This divine sonship, into which  the  believer is introduced  by adoption, includes the following principal elements and advantages-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Derivation  of  spiritual  nature  from  God:  "That  ye  might  be partakers of the divine nature." (2 Pet. 1:4; John 1:13; James 1:18; 1 John 5:18.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The being born in the image of God, the bearing his likeness: "And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him." (Col. 3:10; Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The bearing his name. (1 John 3:1; Rev. 2:17; 3:12.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The being made the objects of his peculiar love: "That the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me." (John 17:23; Rom. 5:5-8.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The indwelling of the Spirit of his Son (Gal. 4:6), who forms in us a filial spirit, or a spirit becoming the children of God-obedient (1 Pet. 1:14; 2 John 6), free from sense of guilt, legal bondage, and fear of death (Rom. 8:15-21; Gal. 5:1; Heb. 2:15), and elevated with a holy boldness and royal dignity. (Heb. 10:19,22; 1 Pet. 2:9; 4:14.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Present  protection,  consolation,  and  abundant  supplies.  (Ps. 125:2; Isa. 66:13; Luke 12:27-32; John 14:18; 1 Cor. 3:21-23; 2 Cor. 1:4.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Present  fatherly  chastisements  for  our  good,  including both spiritual and temporal afflictions. (Ps. 51:11,12; Heb. 12:5-11.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The certain inheritance of the riches of our Father's glory, as "heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ" (Rom. 8:17; James 2:5; 1 Pet. 1:4; 3:7),  including  the  exaltation  of  our  bodies  in  fellowship  with  the Lord. (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21.)</li>

They, who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having  a  new  heart,  and  a  new  spirit  created  in  them,  are  further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection,[1] by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them:[2] the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed,[3] and the several lusts  thereof  are  more  and  more  weakened  and  mortified;[4]  and they more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces, [5] to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.[6]</p>

<p>This chapter teaches the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>All  of  those  in  whom  God  has  by  regeneration  created  a  new spiritual nature continue under his gracious influence, his Word and Spirit dwelling in them, and thus have the grace implanted in them developed more and more.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This work of sanctification involves both the gradual  destruction of  the  old  body  of  sin,  and  the  quickening  and  strengthening  of  all the graces of the new man, and the inward purification of the heart and mind, as well as all those holy actions which proceed from them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  work  of  sanctification  involves  the  entire  man  --  intellect, affections and will, soul and body.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is never perfect in this life, but in every case, as in that of Paul, there remains more or less of the old "law in our members," warring against the law of our mind.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  nevertheless,  from  a  constant  supply  of  strength  from  the sanctifying  Spirit  of  Christ,  the  gracious  element  in  the  believer's nature  prevails,  and  he  gradually  advances  in  holiness  until  he  is made perfect at death.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God,  having  implanted  in  regeneration  a  new  spiritual  nature  in the subject of his grace, always continues to foster and develop that principle, by the indwelling of his word and Spirit, until it attains full perfection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The word "to sanctify" is used in two different  senses  in  Scripture. (1.) To consecrate, or set apart from a common to a sacred use. John x. 36; Matt. xxiii. 17. (2.) To render morally pure or holy. 1 Cor. vi. 11; Heb.  xiii.  12.  In  the  latter  sense  of  the  word,  regeneration  is  the commencement of sanctification, and sanctification is the completion of the work commenced in regeneration. As regeneration is  an  act  of  God's  free  grace,  so  sanctification  is  a  gracious  work  of God,  and  eminently  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  It  is  attributed  to  God absolutely  (1  Thess.  v.  23);  to  the  Son  (Eph.  v.  25,  26);  and  preeminently to the Holy Spirit (2 Thess. ii. 13), whose especial office in the economy of redemption it is to apply the grace secured through the mediation of the Son.</p>
<p>The means of sanctification are of two distinct orders -- (a.) inward and (b.) outward.</p>
<p>The inward means of sanctification is faith. Faith is the instrument of our justification -- and hence of our deliverance from condemnation and communion with God -- the organ of our union with Christ an fellowship with  his Spirit. Faith, moreover,  is  that act of the regenerated soul whereby it embraces and experiences the power of the truth, and whereby the inward experiences of the heart and the outward actions of the life are brought into obedience to the truth.</p>
<p>The outward mean of sanctification are --</p>
<p>(1.) The truth as revealed in the inspired Scriptures: "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth." John xvii. 17, 19. "As new-born babes,  desire  the  sincere  milk  of  the  word,  that  ye  may  grow thereby."  1  Pet.  i.  22;  ii.  2.  The  truth,  as  the  outward  means  of sanctification, stands in correlation to faith, the inward means of it. Conf. Faith, chap. xiv., section 2: This faith " acteth differently upon that  which  every  particular  passage  thereof  containeth;  yielding obedience  to  the  commands,  trembling  at  the  threatenings,  and embracing  the  promises  of  God  for  this  life  and  that  which  is  to come." By this means  the truth nourishes and exercises the principles of grace implanted in the soul.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) The sacraments. Matt. iii. 11; 1 Cor. xii. 13; 1 Pet. iii. 21.</li>
<li>(3.) Prayer is a means of sanctification -- (a.) as the act in which the soul  engages  in  communion  with  God;  and  (b.)  since  God  has</li>
</ul>
<p>promised to answer believing prayer with the donation of spiritual gifts. John xiv. 13, 14.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4.) The gracious discipline of God's providence. John xv. 2; Rom. v. 3, 4; Heb. xii. 5 -- 11.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be remembered that while the subject is passive with respect to  that  Divine  act  of  grace  whereby  he  is  regenerated,  after  he  is regenerated  he  co-operates  with  the  Holy  Ghost  in  the  work  of sanctification.  The  Holy  Ghost  gives  the  grace,  and  prompts  and directs in its exercise, and  the soul exercises it. Thus, while sanctification is a grace, it is also a duty; and the soul is both bound and encouraged to use with diligence, in dependence upon the Holy Spirit,  all  the  means  for  its  spiritual  renovation,  and  to  form  those habits of resisting evil and of right action in which sanctification so largely consists. The fruits of sanctification are good works. An action to be good must have its origin in a holy principle in the heart, and must be conformed to the law of God. Although not the ground of our acceptance, good works are absolutely essential to salvation, as the necessary consequences of a gracious state of soul and perpetual requirements of the divine law. Gal. v. 22, 23; Eph. ii. 10; John xiv. 21.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This work of sanctification involves the destruction of the old body of sin, as well as the development  of  the  grace  implanted  in regeneration: it is also first inward and spiritual, and then outward and practical.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That  the  whole  body  of  death  is  not  immediately  destroyed  in  the instant  of  regeneration  is  plainly  taught  in  the  sixth  and  seventh chapters  of  Romans,  in  the  recorded  experience  of  many  Biblical characters, and in the universal experience of Christians in modern times.  It  hence  necessarily  follows  that  the  tendencies  graciously implanted and sustained must come in conflict with the tendencies to  evil  which  remain.  They  can  co-exist  only  in  a  state  of  active antagonism, and as the one gains in prevalence the other must lose.</p>
<p>"They  that  are  Christ's  have  crucified  the  flesh,  with  the  affections and lusts." Gal. v. 24. " Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth." Col. iii. 5.</p>
<p>That this work begins in the state of the heart, and governs the life by previously governing the heart, is evident -- (1.) From the known fact of  human  nature  that  the  moral  character  of  all  actions  is  derived from the inward moral dispositions and affections which prompt to them. (2.) The same is asserted in the Scriptures. Luke vi. 45. As the character of the fruit is determined by the character of the tree which produces it, so the moral character of actions depends upon the heart from which they proceed: " Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt." Matt. xii. 33. (3.) Truly good works can be produced only by a heart in living union with Christ: "As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so more can ye, except ye abide in me." John xv. 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  work  of  sanctification  involves  the  entire  man  --  intellect, affections, and will, soul and body.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  is  proved  --  (1.)  From  the  necessity  of  the  case.  Our  natural, sinful condition, involves blindness of mind, as well as hardness or perverseness  of  heart.  (2.)  From  the  fact  that  we  are  sanctified  by means  of  the  truth.  (3.)  It  is  explicitly  asserted  in  Scripture  that sanctification  involves  spiritual  illumination:  "That  the  God  of  our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom  and  revelation  in  the  knowledge  of  him:  the  eyes  of  your understanding being en- lightened; that ye may know," etc. Eph. i. 17, 18; Col. iii, 10; 2 Cor. iv. 6; 1 Thess. v. 23.</p>
<p>As our bodies are integral parts of our persons, their  instincts  and appetites act immediately upon the passions of our souls; and hence they must be brought subject to the control of the sanctified will, and all the members of the body, as organs of the soul, made instruments of righteousness unto God. Rom. vi. 13; 1 Thess. iv. 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This work of sanctification is never perfected in this life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different parties of Perfectionists maintain that perfection is possible in this life, in different senses. Pelagians maintain -- (1.) That the law of God respects only the voluntary exercises and actions, and not the states of the soul. (2.) That obligation is always limited by ability -that the law of God can demand no more than its subject is fully able to render. Hence from the very limits of moral obligation it follows that every man is always perfectly able to do all that is required of him. Hence he can be perfect whenever he pleases.</p>
<p>Arminian  and  Papist  Perfectionists  hold  --  (1.)  That  men  can  do nothing morally right without divine grace; and (2.) That even with this grace no man is able perfectly to keep the original Adamic law of absolute  perfection.  They  maintain,  however,  that  God  for  Christ's merits' sake has graciously lowered the demands of the law, in the case  of  believers,  from  absolute  perfection  to  faith  and  evangelical obedience. They hold that it is the privilege and duty of all men in this life to attain to a state of perfect love and sincere obedience to the gospel law, which they call gracious or Christian perfection.</p>
<p>The Papists make a distinction between voluntary transgressions of known law, and concupiscence, or the involuntary first movements of  the  remains  of  corruption  within  the  regenerate.  The  latter  they deny  to  be  properly  of  the  nature  of  sin.  John  Wesley  teaches  the same. Methodist Doctrinal Tracts, pp. 294-312.</p>
<p>But that concupiscence, or the first movement and tendencies of evil desire  in  the  hearts  of  regenerated  men,  is  of  the  nature  of  sin,  is distinctly  affirmed  in  our  Standards.  Conf.  Faith,  ch.  vi.,  section  5. That this is true is proved: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) All men judge that the mora1 state of the soul which determines, or tends to determine, evil action, is itself essentially evil, and indeed the true source of the evil in the action.</li>
<li>(2.)  All  genuine  Christians  experience  involves  the  same  practical judgment. The main element in all genuine conviction of sin is, not simply  that  the  thoughts,  words,  and  feelings  are  wrong,  but  that, lying  far  below  all  exercises  or  volitions,  the  nature  is  morally corrupt.  It  is  his  deadness  to  divine  things  --  blindness,  hardness, aversion  to  God  --  which  he  is  helpless  to  change,  that  chiefly oppresses the truly convicted man with a sense of sin; and in some degree  the  same  conviction  remains  until  death.  (3.)  It  is  of  the essence of the moral law that it demands all that ought to be. Every even the least deficiency from the whole measure of moral excellence that  ought  to  be  is  of  the  nature  of  sin.  Therefore  nothing  short  of absolute conformity to the Adamic law of absolute holiness is of the nature of sinless perfection, or ought to be called by that name.</li>
<li>(4.)  All  the  prayers  and  hymns  and  devotional  literature  of  the Wesleyan,  and  other  evangelical  Churches  which  profess  a  sort  of perfectionism, acknowledge sin in the believer. Dr. Peck admits that the workings of concupiscence, or remaining spontaneous tendency to evil in the heart of the perfect Christian, are an occasion for selfabhorrence  and  confession,  that  they  need  forgiveness  and  the constant  application  of  the  atoning  blood  of  Christ.  We  agree  with this; and maintain, therefore, that these remains of corruption in all Christians  are  of  the  nature  of  sin;  and  that  consequently  the Christians in whom they remain are not perfect.</li>
<li>(5.)  Paul  expressly  calls  concupiscence,  sin:  "  I  had  not  known  sin, but by the law: for I had not known concupiscence, except the law had said, Thou shalt not experience concupiscence." Rom. vii. 7. The sin that dwelt in Paul wrought in him against his will, and wrought in him all manner of concupiscence. Rom. vii. 14 -- 25. And yet this evil tendency,  this  law  in  his  members  warring  against  the  law  of  his spirit, is expressly called " sin;" and in other passages it is called the " old man," the "body of sin." Col. ii. 11; iii. 9.</li>
<li>(6.)  The  biographies  and  recorded  testimonies  of  all  the  Scripture saints make it impossible to attribute sinless perfection to any one of</li>
</ul>
<p>them.  Paul  disclaims  it.  Rom.  vii.  14  --  25;  Phil.  iii.  12  --  14.  John disclaims it in his own behalf and that of all Christians. 1 John i. 8.</p>
<p>The  word  "  perfect"  is  applied  to  some  men  in  Scripture  either  to mark  comparative  excellence,  or  to  assert  genuine  sincerity  in profession  and  service.  But  the  inspired  biographies  of  the  men themselves -- such as of David, Acts xiii. 22; Noah, Gen. vi. 9; and Job, Job i. 1 -- prove very clearly that the perfection intended was not a sinless one.</p>
<ul>
<li>(7.)  Perfectionism  is  in  conflict  with  the  universal  experience  and observation of God's people. The  personal profession of it is generally  judged  to  be  just  ground  for  serious  suspicions  as  to  the claimant's mental soundness or moral sincerity.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless, from  a constant supply  of strength from  the sanctifying  Spirit  of  Christ,  the  gracious  element  in  the  believer's nature,  upon  the  whole,  prevails,  and  he  gradually  advances  in holiness  until  he  is  rendered  perfect  at  death.  This  precious  truth follows necessarily from the fact, already shown, that sanctification is a  work  of  God's  free  grace  in  execution  of  his  eternal  purposes  of salvation.  Wherefore  v  e  are  "confident  of  this  very  thing,  that  He which hath begun a good work in us will perform it until the day of Jesus  Christ,"  Phil.  i.  6;  the  certainty  of  which  will  be  further discussed under chapter xvii.</li>

<li>
<p>I. The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving  of  their  souls,[1]  is  the  work  of  the  Spirit  of  Christ  in  their hearts,[2] and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word,[3] by  which  also,  and  by  the  administration  of  the  sacraments,  and prayer, it is increased and strengthened.[4]</p>

<p>Faith, in the most general sense of the word, is the assent of the mind to  the  truth  of  that  of  which  we  have  not  an  immediate  cognition; knowledge is the perception of the truth of that of which we have an immediate cognition. Yet faith demands and rests upon evidence just as  absolutely  as  does  knowledge.  It  does  not  differ  from  reason  as rational differs from irrational, nor from knowledge as the conviction of that which is proved differs from the presumption of that which is unproved. Faith, like knowledge itself, demands evidence, and differs in  accordance  with  the  evidence  in  different  cases  from  the  barest probability up  to the most  assured  certainty. We  have  direct knowledge that the book we have in our hands fills a certain portion of  space;  we  have  faith  that  space  still  stretches  illimitable  beyond the most distant telescopic star. The one is knowledge and the other faith, but the faith is just as certain as the knowledge. We know the existence and attributes of the city in which we dwell; we believe the existence and attributes of ancient Athens or modern Yeddo from the testimony  of  men.  We  know  the  properties  of  human  nature;  we believe  the  properties  of  the  several  persons  of  the  Trinity  on  the testimony  of  God.  In  each  case  the  faith  is  just  as  rational  and  as certain  as  the  knowledge.  Faith  in  many  thousands  of  its  forms  is spontaneously  exercised  by  all  men.  The  commonest  processes  of thought  and  of  human  action,  individual  or  associated,  would  be impossible  without  it.  When  grounded  on  legitimate  evidence,  it leads to absolute assurance. It has its root in the reason, to which it always,  when  legitimate,  conforms.  But  it  reaches  beyond  reason, and elevates the mind to the contemplation of the highest and-most ennobling truths.</p>
<p>Religious faith, in the most general sense of that word, is the assent of the mind to the general truths of religion, such as the being and attributes  of  God,  and  the  religious  obligations  of  men,  such  as  is common  to  all  religions,  true  or  false.  This  religious  faith  has  its ground in our common religious nature, while on the other hand that SAVING FAITH which is the subject of this chapter of the Confession is  that  spiritual  discernment of  the  excellence  and  beauty  of  divine truth,  and  that  cordial  embrace  and  acceptance  of  it,  which  are wrought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Of this saving faith it is alarmed in this section: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is wrought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is ordinarily wrought by the means of the Word of God, or through the instrumentality of divine truth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is strengthened by the use of the sacraments and prayer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That faith is the work of the Holy Ghost has been proved already under the head of Effectual Calling. In addition it may be argued -(1.) Saving faith must be a moral act, and must have its ground in the spiritual  congeniality  of  the  believer  with  the  truth.  Unbelief  is always denounced as a sin, and not as the consequence of intellectual weakness. The Scriptures unconditionally demand instant faith alike of  the  ignorant  and  of  the  intelligent.  (2.)  By  nature,  men  are spiritually blind, in-- capable of discerning spiritual things. 1 Cor. ii. 14;  2  Cor.  iv.  4.  That  form  of  spiritual  apprehension  which  is  an essential element in saving faith must be wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit. (3.) Men believe because they are taught of God (John vi. 44,  45),  as  they  are  enlightened  to  discern  the  things  of  the  Spirit. Acts xiii. 48; 2 Cor. iv. 6; Eph. i. 17, 18. Faith is the gift of God. Eph. ii. 8.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That faith is ordinarily wrought by the Spirit through the ministry of  the  Word  is  plain  --  (1.)  From  the  direct  assertion  of  Scripture: "How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? ..... So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Rom. x. 12 -- 17. (2.) The</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>preaching of the gospel is the ordinary way in which its truth is most effectually brought to bear upon the hearts and consciences of men. Faith is the act of the regenerated soul, and, as we have seen (ch. x., sections 1, 2 and 4), the Spirit uses the revealed truth of God as his instrument  in  regeneration  and  sanctification,  and  sane  adult  men never come to the experience of the benefits of Christ's salvation who are destitute of some knowledge of his person and world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>We  have  seen  above,  under  chapter  xiii.,  that  sanctification  is  a progressive  work  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  that  the  inward  means whereby it is advanced is faith, and the outward means are the truth, prayer, the sacraments, and the gracious discipline of divine providence. Whatever tends to promote sanctification must promote the strength of faith, which is its main root. Therefore, faith must be nourished by the truth, prayer, the sacraments, and every means of grace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>II. By  this  faith,  a  Christian  believeth  to  be  true  whatsoever  is revealed  in  the  Word,  for  the  authority  of  God  himself  speaking therein;[5]  and  acteth  differently  upon  that  which  each  particular passage thereof containeth; yielding obedience to the commands,[6] trembling at the threatenings,[7] and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come.[8] But the principal acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for  justification,  sanctification,  and  eternal  life,  by  virtue  of  the covenant of grace.[9]</li>

<li>
<ol>
<li>That  saving  faith  rests  upon  the  truth  of  the  testimony  of  God speaking in his Word.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  it  respects  as  its  object  all  the  contents  of  God's  Word, without exception.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  complex  state  of  mind  to  which  the  epithet  "faith"  is applied in Scripture varies with the nature of the particular passage of God's Word which is its object.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the specific act of saving faith which unites us to Christ, and is  the  sole  condition  or  instrument  of  justification,  involves  two essential  elements:  (1.)  Assent  to  what  the  Scriptures  reveal  to  us concerning the person, offices, and work of Christ; and (2.) Trust or implicit reliance  upon  Christ,  and  upon  Christ  alone,  for  all  that  is involved in a complete salvation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Saving faith rests upon the truth of the testimony of God speaking in his Word. The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, having been given by inspiration, are in the strictest and most direct sense God's  Word  to  us.  They  are  absolutely  divine,  both  as  to  their infallible truth and supreme authority. Christ when on earth rested his  claims  to  recognition  as  Messiah  upon  the  testimony  borne  to him  by  the  Father.  John  v.  31  --  37.  "He  that  hath  received  the testimony [of Christ] hath set to his seal that God is true." John iii. 33.  "He  that  believeth  not  God  hath  made  him  a  liar,  because  he believeth  not  the  record  that  God  gave  of  his  Son."  1  John  v.  10.  " This is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son." I John v. 9. The gospel which Paul preached to the Corinthians he calls "the testimony  of  God."  1  Cor.  ii.  1.  God  corroborated  the  truths  of  the apostles'  preaching,  "bearing  them  witness  both  with  signs  and wonders," etc. Heb. ii. 4, The Holy Ghost bears direct witness to the soul of the believer. Rom. viii. 16; Heb. x. 15.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Saving  faith  receives  as  true  all  the  contents  of  God's  Word, without exception. After we have settled the preliminary questions as</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to  what  book  belong  to  the  inspired  canon  of  Scripture,  and  as  to what  is  the  original  text  of  those  books,  then  the  whole  must  be received  as  equally  the  Word  of  God,  and  must  in  all  its  parts  be accepted with equal faith. The same illumination of the understanding and renewal of the affections which lays the foundation  for  the  soul's  acting  faith  in  any  one  portion  of  God's testimony, lays the same foundation for its acting faith in every other portion.  The  whole  Word  of  God,  therefore,  as  far  as  known  to  be individual,  to  the  exclusion  of  all  traditions,  doctrines  of  men,  or pretended private revelation, is the object of saving faith.</p>
<ol>
<li>The complex state of mind to which the epithet "faith" is applied in Scripture varies with the nature of every particular passage of God's Word which is its object. The common quality which is the reason of the application of the same term to all these various states of mind, is cordial, realizing assent to the truth presented. But the state of mind which  fully  realizes  the,  truth  of  a  threatening  must,  in  some respects, be different from that which realizes the truth of a promise. The realization of the truth of God's glory as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ cannot be an experience in all respects the same with the believing recognition of a duty or of the truth of a fact of history.</li>
</ol>
<p>It  was  debated  largely  between  the  Romanists  and  the  Reformers whether saving faith included trust or not. The true answer is, that trust  is  an  integral  and  inseparable  element  of  every  act  of  saving faith  in  which  trust  is  appropriate  to  the  nature  of  the  object believed. It is plain that many of the propositions of Scripture are not the proper objects of trust. In all such cases faith includes recognition,  assent,  acquiescence,  submission,  as  the  case  may  be. But in all cases in which the nature of the truth believed renders the exercise  of  trust  legitimate,  and  especially  in  that  specific  act  of saving faith called justifying faith, which unites to Christ and is the root  and  organ  of  the  whole  spiritual  life,  trust  is  certainly  an element of the very essence of that state of mind called in Scripture faith. This will be proved under the next head.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That specific act of saving faith which unites to Christ, and is the sole condition and instrument of justification, involves two essential elements: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) Assent to whatever the Scriptures reveal to us as to the person, offices, and work of Christ. (a.) The Scriptures expressly say that we are justified by that faith of which Christ is the object. Rom. iii. 22, 25;  Gal.  ii.  16;  Phil.  iii.  9.  (b.)  Rejection  of  Christ  in  Scripture  is declared  to  be  the  ground  of  reprobation.  John  iii.  18,  19;  viii.  24. Assent includes an intellectual recognition and a cordial embrace of the object at the same time. It is an act of the whole man -- intellect, affection, and will -- embracing the truth. This especial act of faith in Christ,  which  secures  salvation,  is  constantly  paraphrased  by  such phrases as "coming to Christ," John vi. 35; "looking to him," Isa. xlv. 22; "receiving him," John i. 12; "fleeing to him for refuge," Heb. vi. 18; -- all of which manifestly involve an active assent to and cordial embrace, as well as an intellectual recognition of the truth.</li>
<li>(2.)  The second element included in that act of faith that saves the soul is trust, or implicit reliance upon Christ, and upon Christ alone, for  all  that  is  involved  in  a  complete  salvation.  (a.)  The  single condition of salvation demanded in the Scriptures is that we should " believe  in  "  or  "  on  "  Christ  Jesus.  And  salvation  is  promised absolutely and certainly if this command is obeyed. John vii. 38; Acts x. 43; xvi. 31; Gal. ii. 16. To believe in or on a person, implies trust as well as credence. (b.) We are constantly said to be saved "by faith in" or "on Christ." Acts xxvi. 18; Gal; iii. 26; 2 Tim. iii. 15. " Faith is the substance  of  things  hoped  for."  Heb.  xi.  1.  Trust  rests  upon  the foundation upon which expectation is based. Hope reaches forward to the object upon  which  desire  and  expectation  meet.  Hope, therefore,  rests  upon  trust,  and  trust  gives  birth  to  hope,  and  faith must include trust in order to give reality or substance to the things hoped for. (c.) The same is proved by what are said to be the effects or fruits of faith. By faith the Christian is said to be " persuaded of the promises; " "to obtain them; " " to embrace them;" " to subdue kingdoms;" " to work righteousness;" "to stop the mouths of lions." Heb.  xi. All this plainly presupposes  that  faith  is not a bare</li>
</ul>
<p>intellectual conviction of the truth of truths revealed in the Scriptures, but that it includes a hearty embrace of and a confident reliance upon Christ, his meritorious work and his gracious promises.</p>
<ul>
<li>III.  This  faith  is  different  in  degrees,  weak  or  strong;[10]  may  be often  and  many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory: [11]  growing  up  in  many  to  the  attainment  of  a  full  assurance, through Christ,[12] who is both the author and finisher of our faith.

<h2 id="chapter-fifteen-of-repentance-unto-life">Chapter Fifteen Of Repentance Unto Life<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-fifteen-of-repentance-unto-life" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>SECTION 1: REPENTANCE unto life is an evangelical grace,(1) the doctrine whereof is to be preached by every minister of the gospel, as well as that of faith in Christ.(2)</p>
<p>SECTION 2: BY it a sinner, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger,  but  also  of  the  filthiness  and  odiousness  of  his  sins,  as contrary to the holy nature and righteous law of God, and upon the apprehension  of  his  mercy  in  Christ  to  such  as  are  penitent,  so grieves for and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God,(3) purposing and endeavoring to walk with him in all the ways of his commandments.(4)</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Zech. 12:10; Acts 11:18. (2) Luke 24:47; Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21. (3) Ezek.  18:30,31;  36:31;  Isa.  30:22;  Ps.  51:4;  Jer.  31:18,  19;  Joel 2:12,13;  Amos  5:15;  Ps.  119:128;  2  Cor.  7:11.  (4)  Ps.  119:6,59,106; Luke 1:6; 2 Kings 23:25.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Confession now approaches the important doctrine of repentance.  Here  we  shall  illuminate  the  basis  and  essence  of repentance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  grounds  of  repentance  are-(1)  A  true  sense  of  sin.  That spiritual illumination and  renewal  of  the affections which  are effected in regeneration brings the believer to see and appreciate the holiness of God as revealed alike in the law and in the gospel (Rom. 3:20;  Job  13:5,6);  and  in  that  light  to  see  and  feel  the  exceeding sinfulness of all sin, and the utter sinfulness of his own nature and conduct. This sense of sin corresponds precisely to the actual facts of the  case,  and  the  man  apprehends  himself  to  be  just  as  God  has always  seen  him  to  be.  It  includes-(a)  Consciousness  of  guilt;  i.e., exposure to merited punishment, as opposed to the justice of God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ps.  51:4,9.) (b) Consciousness  of  pollution,  as  opposed  to  the holiness of God. (Ps. 51:5,7,10.) And (c) Consciousness of helplessness. (Ps. 51:11; 109:21,22.)</p>
<p>The  grounds  of  repentance  are-(2)  A  bright  apprehension  of  the mercy of God in Christ. This is necessary in order to true repentance(a) Because the awakened conscience echoes God's law, and can be appeased  by  no  less  a  propitiation  than  that  demanded  by  divine justice itself; and until this is realized in a believing application to the merits  of  Christ  either  indifference  will  stupefy  or  remorse  will torment the soul. (b) Because out of Christ God is "a consuming fire," and  an  inextinguishable  dread  of  his  wrath  repels  the  soul.  (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29.) (c) A sense of the amazing goodness of God to us in the gift of his Son, and of our ungrateful requital of it, is the most powerful means of bringing the soul to genuine repentance for sin as committed  against  God.  (Ps.  51:4.)  (d)  This  is proved  by  the examples of repentance recorded in Scripture (Ps. 51:1; 130:4), and by the universal experience of Christians in modern times.</p>
<ol>
<li>As to its essence, true repentance consists-(1) In a sincere hatred of sin, and sorrow for our own sin (Ps. 119:128,136). Sin is seen to be exceeding sinful in the light of the divine holiness, of the law of God, and especially of the cross of Christ. The more we see of God in the face of Christ, the more we abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes. (Job 13:5,6; Ezek. 36:31). "Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of." (2 Cor. 7:10.) "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Rom. 3:20); and hence "the law is our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ." (Gal. 3:24.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The essence of repentance consists-(2) In our actual turning from all sin unto God. This is that practical turning, or "conversion" from sin unto  God,  which  is  the  instant  and  necessary  consequence of regeneration.  It  is  a  voluntary  forsaking  of  sin  as  evil  and  hateful, with sincere sorrow, humiliation, and confession; and a turning unto God as our reconciled Father, in the exercise of implicit faith in the merits and assisting grace of Christ. This is marked by the meaning of  the  Greek  word  used  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  express  the  idea  of repentance-"a  change  of  mind,"  including  evidently  a  change  or thought, feeling, and purpose, corresponding to our new character as the  children  of  God.  If  this  be  sincere,  it  will  of  course  lead  to  the element  of  practical  repentance,  namely,  (3)  A  sincere  purpose  of, and a persevering endeavor after, new obedience. (Acts 26:20.)</p>
<p>By these marks it may be seen that repentance unto life can only be exercised by a soul after, and in consequence of, its regeneration by the Holy Spirit. God regenerates; and we, in the exercise of the new gracious  ability  thus  given,  repent.  Repentance  and  conversion, therefore, are terms applying often to the same gracious experience. The  Scriptural  usage  of  the  two  words  differs  in  two  respects-(1) Conversion  is  the  more  general  term,  including  all  the  various experiences involved in our commencing the divine life. It especially emphasizes  that  experience  as  a  turning  unto  God.  Repentance  is more  specific,  giving  prominence  to  the  work  of  the  law  upon  the conscience, and especially emphasizing the experiences attending the new birth as a turning from sin. (2) Conversion is generally used to designate only the first actings of the new nature at the commencement of a religious life, or the first steps of a return to God after a notable backsilding (Luke 22:32); while repentance is a daily experience of the Christian as long as the struggle with sin continues in his heart and life. (Ps. 19:12,13; Luke 9:23; Gal. 6:14; 5:24.)</p>
<p>There is a false repentance experienced before regeneration, and by those  never  regenerated,  which  arises  simply  from  the  common operations of the truth and the Spirit upon the natural conscience, exciting simply a sense of guilt and pollution, leading neither to the hatred of sin, nor to the apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, nor to the practical turning from sin unto God. The genuineness of true repentance is proved (a) By its being conformed perfectly to the requirements  and  teachings  of  Scripture,  and  (b)  By  its  fruits.  If genuine, it infallibly springs from regeneration and leads to eternal life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  thus  defined,  repentance  is,  like  faith,  an  evangelical  grace, given  to  us  for  Christ's  sake,  as  well  as  a  duty  obligatory  upon  us. What is here said of repentance is equally true of every characteristic experience of the subject of regeneration and sanctification. Christ is the  vine;  we  are  the  branches.  But  we  see  also  free,  accountable agents. Every Christian duty is therefore a grace; for without him we can do nothing. (John 15:5). And equally every Christian grace is a duty; because the grace is given to us to exercise, and it finds its true result and expression only in the duty.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That it is thus a gift of God is evident-(1) From its nature. It involves true  conviction of sin;  a  holy  hatred  of  sin;  faith  in  the  Lord  Jesus and his work, which faith is God's gift. (Gal. 5:22; Eph. 2:8. (2) It is directly  affirmed  in  Scripture.  Zech.  12:10;  Acts  5:31;  11:18;  2  Tim. 2:25.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  it  should  be  diligently  preached  by  every  minister  of  the gospel  is  (1)  Self-evident  from  the  essential  nature  of  the  duty.  (2) Because such preaching was included in the commission Christ gave to the apostles. (Luke 24:47,48.) (3) Because of the example of the apostles. (Acts 20:21.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 3: ALTHOUGH repentance be not to be rested in, as an, satisfaction for sin, or any cause of the pardon thereof,(5) which  is the act of God's free grace in Christ;(6) yet is it of such necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon without it.(7)</p>
<p>SECTION 4: AS there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation; (8) so there is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly repent.(9)</p>
<p>SECTION 5 : Men ought not to content themselves with  a  general repentance, but it is  every  man's  duty  to  endeavor  to  repent  of  his particular sins particularly.(10)</p>
<p>(5) Ezek. 36:31,32; 16:61,63. (6) Hos. 14:2,4; Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:7. (7) Luke 13:3,5; Acts 17:30,31. (8) Rom. 6:23; 5:12; Matt. 12:36. (9) Isa.</p>
<p>55:7; Rom. 8:1; Isa. 1:16,18. (10) Ps. 19:13; Luke 19:8; 1 Tim. 1:13,15.</p>
<p>These sections teach the following propositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Repentance is not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for sin, or any cause of the pardon thereof. This directly contradicts the opinion of Socinians, the advocates of the moral-influence theory of the atonement, and Rationalists generally, to the effect that the repentance of the sinner is the only satisfaction the law requires, and hence the only condition God demands, as prerequisite to full pardon and restoration to divine favor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It also contradicts  the  Roman  doctrine  of  penance.  Romanists distinguish  penance-(1)  As  a  virtue,  which  is  internal,  including sorrow for sin and a turning from sin unto God. (2) As a sacrament, which is the external expression of the internal state. This sacrament consists of (a) Contrition-i.e., sorrow and detesting of past sins, with a purpose of sinning no more; (b) Confession or self-accusation to a priest having jurisdiction and the power of the keys; (c) Satisfaction or some painful work, imposed by the priest and performed by the penitent, to satisfy divine justice for sins committed;  and  (d) Absolution,  pronounced  by  the  priest  judicially,  and  not  merely declaratively. They hold that the element of satisfaction included in this  sacrament  makes  a  real  satisfaction  for  sin,  and  is  an  efficient cause  of  pardon,  absolutely  essential-the  only  means  whereby  the pardon of sins committed after baptism can be secured. (Cat. Rom., part 2., ch. 5., qs. 12, 13.)</p>
<p>That repentance is no cause whatever of the pardon of sin is proved by all that the Scriptures teach us-(1) As to the justice of God, which inexorably demands the punishment of every sin;</p>
<ul>
<li>(2)  As  to  the  necessity  for  the  satisfaction  rendered  to  the  law  and justice of God by the obedience and suffering of Christ; (3) As to the fact that he has rendered a full satisfaction in behalf of all for whom he died; (4) As to the impossibility of any man's securing justification</li>
</ul>
<p>by  works  of  any  kind;  and  (5)  As  to  the  fact  that  the  believer  is justified solely on the ground of the righteousness of Christ, imputed to him and received by faith alone. All these points have already been discussed  under  their  appropriate  heads;  and  they  are  more  than sufficient to prove-(a) That pardon is secured entirely on a different basis; (b) That the external penance of the Romanist is an impertinent attempt to supplement the perfect satisfaction of Christ; and (c) That internal repentance, when genuine, is itself a gracious gift  of  God,  without  merit  in  itself;  and  of  value  only  because  it springs from the application of Christ's grace to the soul, and leads to the application by the soul to Christ's grace.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless,  repentance  is  of  such  necessity  to  all  sinners  that none may expect pardon without it. This is evident-(1) Because the giving  of  pardon  to  a  non-repentant  sinner  would  be  in  effect  to sanction his sin, to confirm him in his sinful state, and to encourage others therein. Although Scripture and the moral sense of men teach that repentance is no adequate satisfaction for sin, nor an equivalent for the penalty, they just as clearly teach that it would be inconsistent in  every  sense  with  good  morals  to  pardon  a  person  cherishing  an unrepentant  spirit. (2) Repentance  is the natural and instant sequence of the grace of regeneration. It also embraces an element of faith in Christ; and that faith is, as we have seen, the instrument of justification. He that repents believes. He that does not repent does not  believe.  He  that  does  not  believe  is  not  justified.  Regeneration and justification are never separated. (3) The design of Christ's work is to "save his people from their sins." Matt. 1:21. He frees them from the guilt of their sins by pardon, and he brings them clear from the power of their sins through repentance. "Him hath God exalted . . . to give  repentance  to  Israel  and  forgiveness  of  sins."  (Acts  5:31.)  (4) Repentance, like faith, is a duty as well as a grace, and ministers are commanded  to  preach  it  as  essential  to  forgiveness.  (Luke  24:47; Acts 20:21.21.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the least sin deserves punishment is obvious. The moral law is  moral  in  every  element,  and  it  is  of  the  essence  of  that  which  is</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>moral  that  it  is  obligatory,  and  that  its  violation  is  deserving  of reprobation.  Hence  "whosoever  shall  keep  the  whole  law,  and  yet offend in one point, is guilty of all." (James 2:10.) That there is no sin so great that it can bring condemnation upon those that truly repent is also evident, because true repentance, as we have seen, is the fruit of regeneration, and no man is regenerated who is not also justified. Besides, true repentance includes faith, and faith unites to Christ and secures the imputation of his righteousness, and the righteousness of Christ of course cancels all possible sin. (Rom. 8:1; 5:20.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That men ought to repent not only in general of the corruption of their hearts and sinfulness of their lives, but also of every particular sinful  action  of  which  they  are  conscious,  and  that  when  possible they should redress the wrong done by their actions, is a dictate alike of natural conscience and scripture. (Luke 19:8; 1 John 1:9.) No man has  any  right  to  presume  that  he  hates  sin  in  general  unless  he practically hates every sin in particular; and no man has any right to presume that he is sorry for and ready to renounce his own sins in general unless he is conscious of practically renouncing and grieving for each particular sin into which he falls.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION 6: AS every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God, praying for the pardon thereof;(11) upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy;(12) so he that scandalizes his brother,  or  the  Church  of  Christ,  ought  to  be  willing  by  private  or public confession and sorrow for his sin, to declare his repentance to those that are offended;(13) who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in love to receive him.(14)</p>

<li>(11) Ps. 51:4,5,7,9,14; 32:5,6. (12) Prov. 28:13; 1 John 1:9. (13) James 5:16; Luke 17:3,4; Josh. 7:19; Ps. 51: (14) 2 Cor. 2:8.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section teaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That every man should make private confession of all his sins to God, and that God will certainly pardon him when his sorrow and his</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>renunciation of his sins are sincere. "If we confess our sins, he (God) is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  when  a  Christian  has  personally  injured  a  bother,  or scandalized  by  his  unchristian  conduct  the  Church  of  Christ,  he ought to be willing, by a public or a private confession, as the case may be, to declare his repentance to those that are offended, is also a dictate  alike  of  natural  reason  and  of  Scripture.  If  we  have  done wrong, we stand in the position of one maintaining a wrong until, by an expressed repentance and, where possible, redress of the wrong, we place ourselves on the side of the right. The wrong-doer is plainly in debt to the man he has injured, to make every possible restitution to  his  feelings  and  interests;  and  the  same  principle  holds  true  in relation  to  the  general  interests  of  the  Christian  community.  The duty  is  expressly  commanded  in  Scripture.  (Matt.  5:23,24;  James 5:16; Matt. 18:15-18.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  it  is  the  duty  of  the  brethren,  or  of  the  Church,  when offended, to forgive the offending party and restore him fully to favor upon his repentance,  is  also  a  dictate  of  natural  conscience  and  of Scripture. All honorable men feel themselves bound to act upon this principle. The Christian is, in addition, brought under obligations to forgive others by his own infinite obligation to his Lord, who not only forgave  us  upon  repentance,  but  died  to  redeem  us  while  we  were unrepentant. As to public scandals, the Church is bound to forgive them when the Lord has done so. As genuine repentance is the gift of Christ,  its  evident  exercise  is  a  certain  indication  that  the  person exercising it is  forgiven  by  Christ  and  is  a  Christian  brother.  (Luke 17:3,4; 2 Cor. 2:7,8; Matt. 6:12.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Roman  Catholic  Church  has  historially  taught  that,  as  an element of penance and evidence of true repentance, the Christian must  confess  all  his  sins  without  reserve,  in  all  their  details  and qualifying circumstances, to a priest having jurisdiction; and that if any mortal sin is unconfessed it is not forgiven; and if the omission is willful, it is sacrilege, and greater guilt is incurred. (Cat. Rom., part 2., ch. 5., qs. 33, 34, 42.) And they maintain that the priest absolves judicially, not merely declaratively, from all the penal consequences of the sins confessed, by the authority of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This is an obvious perversion of the Scriptural command to confess. They bid us simply to confess our faults one to another. There is not a word said about confession to a priest in the Bible. The believer, on the  contrary,  has  immediate  access  to  Christ,  and  to  God  through Christ (1 Tim. 2:5; John 14:6; 5:40; Matt. 11:28), and is commanded to  confess  his  sins  immediately  to  God.  (1  John  1:9.)  No  priestly function  is  ever  ascribed  to  the  Christian  ministry  in  the  New Testament. The power of absolute forgiveness of sin belongs to God alone  (Matt.  9:26),  is  incommunicable  in  its  very  nature,  and  has never  been  granted  to  any  class  of  men  as  a  matter  of  fact.  The authority to bind or loose which Christ committed to his Church was understood  by  the  apostles,  as  is  evident  from  their  practice,  as simply  conveying  the  power  of  declaring  the  conditions  on  which God  pardons  sin;  and,  in  accordance  with  that  declaration,  of admitting or of excluding men from sealing ordinances.</p>

<p>THESE sections teach the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>l.  In  order  that  any  human  action  should  be  truly  a  good  work,  it must have the following essential characteristics: --</li>
<li>(1.) It must be something directly or implicitly commanded by God.</li>
<li>(2.) It must spring from an inward principle of faith and love in the heart. Works not commanded by God, but invented and gratuitously performed  by  men,  are  utterly  destitute  of  moral  character,  and  if offered in the place of the obedience required, they are offensive.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  effects  and  uses  of  good  works  in  the  Christian  life  are manifold,  and  are  such  as  --  (1.)  They  express  the  gratitude  of  the believer,  and  manifest  the  grace  of  God  in  him,  and  so  adorn  the profession  of  the  gospel.  (2.)  They  glorify  God.  (3.)  They  develop grace  by  exercise,  and  so  strengthen  the  believer's  assurance.  (4.) They  edify  the  brethren.  (5.)  They  stop  the  mouths  of  adversaries. (6.) They are necessary to the attainment of eternal life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>In order that a work may be good, (1.) It must be an act performed in  conformity  to  God's  revealed  will.  The  law  of  absolute  moral perfection  to  which  we  are  held  in  subjection  is  not  the  law  of  our own  reasons or consciences, but it is an all-perfect rule of righteousness, having its ground in the eternal nature of God, and its expression and obliging authority to us in the divine will. Not selfdevelopment, not the realization of an ideal end, but obedience to a personal  authority  without  and  above  us,  is  precisely  what  reason, conscience,  and  Scripture  require.  The  good  man  is  the  obedient man. The sinner in every transgression of virtue is conscious that he is guilty of disobedience to the Supreme Lawgiver. David says in his repentance,  "Against  thee,  thee  only,  have  I  sinned,  and  done  this evil in thy sight" Ps. li. 4. God has given in the inspired Scriptures a perfect rule of faith and practice. Every principle, every motive, and every end of right action, according to the will of God, may there be easily learned by the devout inquirer. God says to his Church: "What thing  soever  I  command  you,  observe  to  do  it:  thou  shalt  not  add thereto,  nor  diminish  from  it."  Deut.  xii.  32;  Rev.  xxii.  18,  19.  And God  very  energetically  declares  his  abhorrence  of  uncommanded services,  of  "  voluntary  humility  "  and  "will-worship."  Isa.  i.  11,  12; Col. ii. 16 -- 23.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order that a work may be truly good, (2.) It must spring from a principle  of  faith  and  love  in  the  heart.  All  men  recognize  that  the moral  character  of  an  act  always  is  determined  by  the  moral character of the principle or affection which prompts to it. Unregenerate  men  perform  many  actions,  good  so  far  as  their external relations to their fellow-men are concerned. But love to God is the foundation-principle upon which all moral duties rest, just as our relation to God is the fundamental relation upon which all our other relations rest. If a man is alienated from God, if he is not in the present exercise of trust in him and love for him, any action he can perform  will  lack  the  essential  element  which  makes  it  a  true obedience. Good works, according to the Scriptures, are the fruits of sanctification,  having  their  root  in  regeneration:  "  For  we  are  his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath  before  ordained  that  we  should  walk  in  them."  Eph.  ii.  10. James says that faith is shown by works; which of course implies that the kind of works of which he speaks springs only from a believing heart. James ii. 18, 22.</p>
<ol>
<li>The  effects  and  uses  of  good  works  in  the  Christian  life  are manifold,  and  are  such  as  --  (1.)  They  express  the  gratitude  of  the believer,  and  manifest  the  grace  of  God  in  him,  and  so  adorn  the profession  of  the  gospel.  "Faith  worketh  by  love."  Gal.  v.  6.  Christ says  that we  are  to  express  our  love  for  him  by  keeping  his commandments. John xiv. 15, 23. As they are the fruits of the Spirit, they render manifest the excellent working of the Spirit. 1 Tim. ii. 10; Tit.  ii.  10.  (2.)  They  glorify  God.  Since  God  is  their  author  (Eph.  ii. 10),  they  manifest  the  excellency  of  his  grace,  and  excite  all  who behold them to appreciate and proclaim his glory. Matt. v. 16; 1 Pet. ii.  12.  (3.)  As  they  spring  from  grace,  so  the  performance  of  them exercises grace in general, and each grace severally according to the nature  of  the  work  performers.  Thus  by  the  universal  law  of  habit grace grows by its exercise. And the assurance as to our own gracious state  naturally  increases  with  the  strength  and  evidence  of  those graces  unto  which  the  promise  of  salvation  is  attached.  (4.)  They edify  the  brethren.  Good  works  edify  others,  both  as  confirmatory evidence of the truth of Christianity and the power of divine  grace, and  by  the  force  of  example  inducing  men  to  practice  the  same.  1 Thess. i. 7; 1 Tim. iv. 12; 1 Pet. v. 3. (5.) For the same reasons good works  disprove  the  cavils  and  render  nugatory  the  opposition  of wicked men. 1 Pet. ii. 15. (6.) They are necessary to the attainment of salvation,  not  in  any  sense  as  a  prerequisite  to  justification,  nor  in any stage of the believer's progress meriting the divine favour, but as essential  elements  of  that  salvation,  the  consubstantial  fruits  and means of sanctification and glorification. A saved soul is a holy soul, and  a  holy  soul  is  one  whose  faculties  are  all  engaged  in  works  of loving obedience. Grace in the heart cannot exist without good works as their consequent. Good works cannot exist without the increase of the  graces  which  are  exercised  in  them.  Heaven  could  not  exist except as a society of holy souls mutually obeying the law of love in all the good works that law requires. Eph. v. 25 -- 27; 1 Thess. iv. 6, 7; Rev. xxi. 27.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION  III.  Their  ability  to  do  good  works  is  not  at  all  of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.[12] And that they may  be  enabled  thereunto,  beside  the  graces  they  have  already received,  there  is  required  an  actual  influence  of  the  same  Holy Spirit, to work in them to will, and to do, of his good pleasure:[13] yet  are  they  not  hereupon  to  grow  negligent,  as  if  they  were  not bound  to  perform  any  duty  unless  upon  a  special  motion  of  the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.[14]</p>
<ol>
<li>John 15:4-6; Rom. 8:4-14; Ezek. 36:26-27 13. Phil. 2:13; 4:13; II Cor. 3:5; Eph. 3:16 14. Phil. 2:12; Heb. 6:11-12; II Peter 1:3, 5, 10-11; Isa. 64:7; II Tim. 1:6; Acts 26:6-7; Jude 1:20-21</li>
</ol>
<p>As  we  have  seen  under  chapter  x.,  in  regeneration  the  Holy  Spirit implants a permanent holy principle or habit in the soul, which ever continues  the  germ  or  seed  from  which  all  gracious  affections  and holy  exercises  do  proceed.  In  respect  to  the  implantation  of  this permanent holy principle by the Holy Spirit the soul is passive. But, the  instant  this  new  moral  disposition  or  tendency  is  implanted  in the soul, as a matter of course the moral character of its exercises is changed, and the soul becomes active in good works, as before it had, been in evil ones. But, as we also saw under chapter xiii., sanctification  is  a  work  of  God's  free  grace,  wherein  he  continues graciously to sustain, nourish, and guide the exercise of the permanent habit of grace which he had implanted in regeneration. The  regenerated  man  depends  upon  the  continued  indwelling,  the prompting, and the sustaining and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit, in every act of obedience in the exercise of grace; nevertheless as  the  acts  of  obedience  to  the  performance  of  which  the  Spirit prompts and enables him are his own acts, it follows that he, while seeking the guidance and support of grace, must actively co-operate with it, acting, like every free agent, under the influence of motives and a sense of personal responsibility. Hence this section asserts: -1. That the ability of the Christian to do good works is not at all from himself, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  in  order  thereto,  in  addition  to  the  grace  implanted  in regeneration, there is needed a continual influence of the Holy Ghost upon all the faculties of the renewed soul, whereby the Christian is enabled to will and to do of his good pleasure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this doctrine of the absolute dependence of the soul is not to be perverted into an occasion to indolence, or to abate in any degree our  sense  of  personal  obligation.  God's  will  is  exhibited  to  us objectively in the written Word. The obligation to voluntary obedience  binds  our  consciences.  The  Holy  Spirit  does  not  work independently of the Word, but through the Word; nor does he work irrespectively  of  our  constitutional  faculties  of  reason,  conscience, and free will, but through them. It hence follows that we can never honour the Holy Spirit by waiting for his special motions, but that we always  yield  to  and  co-work  with  him  when  we,  while  seeking  his guidance and assistance, use all the means of grace, and all our own best energies, in being and doing all that the law of God requires. It is</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>never the waiters for grace, but always the active seekers for grace and doers of his word, whom God approves. Luke xi. 19-13; James i. 22, 23.</p>
<p>SECTION  IV.  They  who,  in  their  obedience,  attain  to  the  greatest height  which  is  possible  in  this  life,  are  so  far  from  being  able  to supererogate,  and  to  do  more  than  God  requires,  as  that  they  fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do.[15]</p>
<ol>
<li>Luke 17:10; Neh. 13:22; Rom. 8:21-25; Gal. 5:17</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION V. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom, by them, we can neither profit, nor  satisfy  for  the  debt  of  our  former  sins,[16]  but  when  we  have done  all  we  can,  we  have  done  but  our  duty,  and  are  unprofitable servants:[17] and because, as they  are  good,  they  proceed  from  his Spirit;[18] and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of God's judgment.[19]</p>

<p>SECTION  VI.  Notwithstanding,  the  persons  of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him; [20]  not  as  though  they  were  in  this  life  wholly  unblamable  and unreprovable in God's sight;[21] but that he, looking upon them in his  Son,  is  pleased  to  accept  and  reward  that  which  is  sincere, although  accompanied  with  many  weaknesses  and  imperfections. [22]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eph. 1:6; I Peter 2:5; see Exod. 28:38; Gen. 4:4; Heb. 11:4</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections teach: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That works of supererogation are so far from being possible, even for the most eminent saint, that in this life it is not possible for the most  thoroughly  sanctified  one  fully  to  discharge  all  his  positive obligations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That, for several reasons assigned, the best works of believers, so far from meriting either the pardon of sin or eternal life at the hands of God, cannot even endure the scrutiny of his holy judgment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That,  nevertheless,  the  works  of  sincere  believers  are,  like  their persons,  in  spite  of  their  imperfections,  accepted  because  of  their union with Christ Jesus, and rewarded for his sake.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  phrase  "  supererogation"  means  "more  than  is  demanded." Works of supererogation are in their own nature impossible under the moral law of God. In man's present state even the most eminent saint  is  incapable  of  fully  discharging  all  his  obligations  --  much more, of course, of surpassing them. The Romish Church teaches the ordinary Arminian theory of perfectionism. In addition to this error, they  teach,  (a.) that good  works  subsequent  to  baptism  merit increase of grace and eternal felicity (Council of Trent, sess. vi., ch. xvi., can. 24, 32);. and (b.) they distinguish between the commands and the counsels of Christ. The former are binding upon all classes of the people, and their observance necessary in order to salvation. The latter,  consisting  of  advice,  not  of  commands  --  such  as  celibacy, voluntary  poverty,  obedience  to  monastic  rule,  etc.  --  are  binding only on those who voluntarily assume them, seeking a higher degree of perfection and a more exalted reward.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We  have  already,  under  chapter  xiii.,  seen  that  a  state  of  sinless perfection  is  never  attained  by  Christians  in  this  life;  and  it,  of course, follows that much less is it possible for any to do more than is commanded.</p>
<p>That works of supererogation are always and essentially impossible to  all  creatures  in  all  worlds  is  also  evident  --  (1.)  From  the  very nature  of  the  moral  law.  That  which  is  right  under  any  relation  is intrinsically obligatory upon  the  moral  agent  standing  in  that relation. If it be moral, it is obligatory. If it be not obligatory, it is not moral. If it is not moral, it is, of course, of no moral value or merit. If it is obligatory, it is not supererogatory. When men do what it is their duty to do, they are to claim nothing for it. Luke xvii. 10. (2.)  The doing  of  that  which  God  has  not  made  it  man's  duty  to  do  --  all manner of will-worship and commandments of men -- God declares is an abomination to him. Col. ii. 18 -- 23 1 Tim. iv. 3 Matt. xv. 9. (3) Christ has given no "counsels," as distinct from his commands. His absolute  and  universal  command  to  love  God  with  the  whole  soul, and our neighbor as ourselves, covers the whole ground of possible ability or opportunity on earth or in heaven. Matt. xxii. 37 -- 40. (4.) Increase of grace and eternal felicity, and all else which the believer needs or is capable of, is secured for him by the purchase of Christ's blood, and either given freely now without price, or is reserved for him in that eternal inheritance which he is to receive as a joint-heir with  Christ.  (5.)  The  working  of  the  Romish  system  of  celibacy, voluntary poverty, and monastic vows, has produced such fruits as prove the principle on which they rest radically immoral and false.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The best works of believers, instead of meriting pardon of sin and eternal life, cannot endure the scrutiny of God's holy judgment. The reasons for this assertion are -- (1.) As above shown, from the nature of the moral law. What is not obligatory is not moral, and what is not moral can have no moral desert. (2.) The best works possible for man are infinitely  unworthy to be compared in value with God's favour, and  the  rewards  which  men  who  trust  to  works  seek  to  obtain through  them.  (3.)  God's  infinite  superiority  to  us,  his  absolute proprietorship  in  us  as  our  Maker,  and  sovereignty  over  us  as  our moral  Governor,  necessarily  exclude  the  possibility  of  our  actions</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>deserving any reward at his hand. No action of ours can profit God or lay him under obligation to us. All that is possible to us is already a debt we owe him as our Creator and Preserver. When we have done our utmost we are only unprofitable servants. Much less, then, can any possible obedience at one moment atone for any disobedience in another  moment.  (4.)  As  already  proved  under  chapter  xiii.,  on Sanctification, our works, which could merit nothing even if perfect, are in this life, because of remaining imperfections, most imperfect. They therefore, the best of them, need to be atoned. for by the blood, and presented through the mediation, of Christ, before they can find acceptance with the Father.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless,  the  good  works  of  sincere  believers  are,  like  their persons,  in  spite  of  their  imperfections,  accepted,  because  of  their union  with Christ Jesus, and  rewarded  for his sake. All our approaches to God are made through Christ. It is only through him that we have access to the Father by the Spirit. Eph. ii. 18. Whatever we do, "in word or deed," we are commanded to "do all in the name of the Lord Jesus." Col. iii. 17.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As to the relation of good works to rewards, it may be observed --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  The  word  "merit,"  in  the  strict  sense  of  the  term,  means  that common quality of all actions or services to which a reward is due, in strict justice, on account of their intrinsic value or worthiness. It is evident that, in this strict sense, no work of any creature can in itself merit  any  reward  from  God;  because  --  (a.)  All  the  faculties  he possesses were originally granted and are continuously sustained by God, so that  he  is  already  so  far  in  debt  to  God  that  he  can  never bring God in debt to him. (b.) Nothing the creature can do can be a just equivalent for the incomparable favour of God and its consequences.</li>
<li>(2.) There is another sense of the word, however, in which it may be affirmed  that  if  Adam  had  in  his  original  probation  yielded  the obedience required, he would have "merited" the reward conditioned</li>
</ul>
<p>upon  it,  not  because  of  the  intrinsic  value  of  that  obedience,  but because  of  the  terms  of  the  covenant  which  God  had  graciously condescended to  form  with  him.  By  nature,  the  creature  owed  the Creator obedience, while the Creator owed the creature nothing. But by  covenant  the  Creator  voluntarily  bound  himself  to  owe  the creature eternal life, upon the condition of perfect obedience.</p>
<p>It  is  evident that in this life the works of God's people can have no merit in either of the senses above noticed. They can have no merit intrinsically, because they are all imperfect, and therefore themselves worthy of punishment rather than of reward. They can have no merit by  covenant  concession  on  God's  part,  because  we  are  not  now standing in God's sight in the covenant of works, but of grace, and the  righteousness of Christ, received  by  faith  alone,  constitutes  the sole meritorious ground upon which our salvation, in all of its stages, rests. See chapter. xi., on Justification.</p>
<p>In the dispensation of the gospel, the gracious world of the believer and the gracious reward he receives from God are branches from the same gracious root. The same covenant of grace provides at once for the infusion of grace in the heart, the exercise of grace in the life, and the reward of the grace so exercised. It is all of grace -- a grace called a reward added to a grace called a work. The one grace is set opposite to the other grace as a reward, for these reasons: (a.) To act upon us as a suitable stimulus to duty. God promises to reward the Christian just  as  a  father  promises  to  reward  his  child  for  doing  what  is  its duty, and what is for its own benefit alone. (b.) Re- cause a certain gracious proportion has been established between the grace given in the reward and the grace given in the holy exercises of the heart and life;  but  both  are  alike  given  for  Christ's  sake.  This  proportion  has been established -- the more grace of obedience, the more grace of reward  --  the  more  grace  on  earth,  the  more  glory  in  heaven  -because God so wills it, and because the grace given and exercised in obedience  prepares  the  soul  for  the  reception  of  the  further  grace given in the reward. Matt. xvi. 27; 1 Cor. iii. 8; 2 Cor. iv. 17.</p>
<p>SECTION VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter  of  them  they  may  be  things  which  God  commands;  and  of good  use  both  to  themselves  and  others:[23]  yet,  because  they proceed not from an heart purified by faith;[24] nor are done in a right  manner,  according  to  the  Word;[25]  nor  to  a  right  end,  the glory of God,[26] they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make  a  man  meet  to  receive  grace  from  God:[27]  and  yet,  their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing unto God.[28]</p>

<p>This section teaches: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That unregenerate men may perform many actions which, for the matter of them, are such as God commands, and are of good use both to themselves  and  others.  The  truth  of  this  is  verified  in  the experience and observation of all men, and we believe it is not called in question by any party.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless,  they  are  at  best,  all  of  them,  not  only  imperfect works, morally considered, but ungodly works religiously considered. They are, therefore, not in the Scriptural sense good works, nor can they satisfy the requirements of God, nor merit grace, nor make the soul fit for the reception of grace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction is plain between an action in itself considered, and considered in its motives and object. A truly good work is one which springs from a principle of divine love, and has the glory of God as its object and the revealed will of God as its rule. None of the actions of an unregenerate man are of this character.</p>
<p>There is also an obvious distinction between an act viewed in in itself abstractly,  and  the  same  action  viewed  in  relation  to  the  person performing  it  and  his  personal  relations.  A  rebel  against  sovereign authority may do many amiable things, and many acts of real virtue, as  far  as  his  relations  to  his  fellow-rebels  are  concerned.  It  is nevertheless  true  that  a  rebel,  during  the  whole  period  of  his rebellion,  is  in  every  moment  of  time  and  every  action  of  his  life  a rebel with reference to that supreme authority which through all he continues to defy. In this sense the ploughing of the wicked is said to be sin. Prov. xxi. 4. And thus as long as men stay away from Christ, and refuse to submit to the righteousness of God, all their use of the means of grace and all their natural virtues are sins in God's sight.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Nevertheless  God  is  more  displeased  with  their  neglecting  to  do these  commanded  duties  at  all  than  he  is  with  their  doing  them sinfully  as  sinners.  These  works  done  by  unregenerate  men  are commanded by God, and hence are their bounden duties. Their sin lies not  in  their  doing  them,  but  in  their  personal  attitude  of rebellion,  and  in  the  absence  of  the  proper  motives  and  objects.  If they neglected to do them, the neglect would he added to the other grounds of condemnation, which would remain all the same. These ought they to do, but not to leave the weightier matters of the law undone.  The  amiable  acts  of  a  rebel  must  involve  elements  of rebellion, and yet he would be more to be condemned without them than with them.</li>

<p>SECTION II.

Nevertheless,  they  may,  through  the  temptations  of Satan  and  of  the  world,  the  prevalency  of  corruption  remaining  in them,  and  the  neglect  of  the  means  of  their  preservation,  fall  into grievous sins;[7] and, for a time, continue therein:[8] whereby they incur God's displeasure,[9] and grieve his Holy Spirit,[10] come to be deprived  of  some  measure  of  their  graces  and  comforts,[11]  have their hearts hardened,[12] and their consciences wounded;[13] hurt and  scandalize  others,[14]  and  bring  temporal  judgments  upon themselves.[15]</p>

<p>This chapter teaches the following propositions: --</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The  true  believer,  having  been  once  regenerated  and  justified  by God, can never afterward totally nor finally fall away from grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to the end. 2. That the principle of this certain perseverance is not in any degree in the free will of the saints,  but  altogether  --  (1.)  In  the  inherent  immutability  of  the eternal  decree  of  election;  (2.)  In  the  provisions  of  the  eternal covenant of grace; (3.) In the merits and intercession of Christ; and. (4.)  In  the  constant  indwelling  and  preserving  power  of  the  Holy Ghost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The true believer may nevertheless fall into grievous sins, and for a time  continue  therein.  The  occasions  of  which  falls  are  --  (1.)  The temptations  of  the  world;  (2.)  The  seductions  of  Satan;  (3.)  The remaining  corruptions  of  their  own  nature;  (4.)  The  neglect  of  the means of grace. The effects of which falls are -- (a.) God is displeased and  the  Holy  Ghost  grieved;  (6.)  They  are  themselves  to  a  degree deprived of their graces and comforts,  their  hearts  being  hardened and  their  consciences  wounded,  and  their  persons  visited  with temporal  judgments;  (a.)  Their  conduct  is  a  stumbling-block  to  all who see them, and an occasion of sorrow to their fellow-Christians.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is obvious that adherents of the Arminian and Calvinistic systems must take opposite sides on this question. The Arminian, as we have seen,  holds  --  (1.)  That  God  elects  persons  to  eternal  life  only  on condition  of  their  voluntary  reception  of  grace  and  perseverance therein till death, as foreseen by him. (2.) That Christ died to render the  salvation  of  all  men  indifferently  possible,  and  not  as  the substitute  of  certain  persons  definitely,  to  discharge  all  their  legal obligations, and to secure for them all the rewards of the covenant. (3.) That all men have the same gracious influence of the Holy Ghost operating upon them, and that the reason why one believes and is regenerated, and that another continues reprobate, is that the former voluntarily cooperates with grace and that the other resists it. Thus, in the  personal  application  of  redemption  the  Arminian  makes everything to depend upon the free will of the creature. Since, then, neither the decree of God, nor the atonement of Christ, nor the grace of the Holy Ghost determines the certain salvation of any individual --since  the  application  and  effect  of  the  atonement  and  of  the renewing  and  sanctifying  influences  of  the  Spirit  depend,  in  their view, upon the free will of every man in his own case -- it necessarily follows that the perseverance of any man in the grace once received must also depend entirely upon his own will. And since the human will  is  essentially  fallible  and  capable  of  change,  and  in  this  life exposed to seduction, it follows, of course, that the believer is at all times  liable  to  total  apostasy,  and  dying  in  that  state,  to  final perdition.  Hence  the  Romish  Church,  whose  doctrine  is  purely Arminian,  declares  in  her  authoritative  Standards:  "  If  any  one maintain that a man once justified cannot lose grace, and therefore that  he  who  falls  and  sins  never  was  truly  justified,  let  him  be accursed." Council of Trent, sess. vi., can. 23.</p>
<p>The Protestant Arminians also hold that it is not only possible, but also  a  frequent  fact,  that,  persons  truly  regenerate,  by  neglecting grace and grieving the Holy Spirit with sin, fall away totally, and at length  finally,  from  grace  into  eternal  reprobation.  Conf.  of  the Remonstrants, xi. 7.</p>
<p>The Calvinistic doctrine, as stated in this chapter of our Confession, is,  that  God  has  revealed  his  gracious  purpose  to  cause  every  true believer to persevere in his faith and obedience till death; that he will never  be  allowed  to  fall  away  totally  from  grace,  and  therefore  he never can fall away finally.</p>
<p>It  is  obvious,  from  this  statement,  that  this  doctrine  is  not  open  to the objections which are often brought against it.</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) It is absurd to say that, it is inconsistent with man's free will. As God does not make a man come to Christ, so he does not constrain him  to  continue  in  Christ,  irrespective  of  his  will.  God  graciously causes a man to persevere in willing. That is the whole truth. It is a precious truth, clearly revealed, which the Arminian Christian can no more afford to give up  than  the  Calvinist,  that  God  can,  and  does, control  the  free  wills  of  his  people  without  limiting  their  liberty, making them "willing in the day of his power," and "working in them</li>
</ul>
<p>both to will and to do of his good pleasure." Ps. cx. 3; Phil. ii. 13. The Arminians themselves believe that the saints will be rendered secure from falling from grace when they go to heaven, and yet that they will be  none  the  less  perfectly  free  as  to  their  wills.  If  the  two  are consistent  conditions  in  heaven,  they  can  be  none  the  less  so  on earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.)  This  doctrine  is  not  liable  to  the  charge  of  fostering  a  spirit  of carnal security, on the ground that if we are once in grace we cannot lose grace or be lost, do what we please. Let it be observed -- (a.) That the  true  doctrine  is  not  that  salvation  is  certain  if  we  have  once believed, but that perseverance in holiness is certain if we have truly believed. (b.) The certainty -- nay, the probability -- of an individual's salvation is known to him only through the fact of his perseverance in  holiness.  A  tendency  to  relax  watchful  effort  to  grow  in  grace because true Christians will not be allowed to fall away totally, is a direct evidence that we are not in a gracious state; and hence that the threatenings of the law and the invitations of the gospel, and not the perseverance  of  the  saints,  are  the  special  truths  applicable  to  our case. (c.) This doctrine teaches, not that persistent effort on our part is not necessary in order to secure perseverance in grace to the end, but  that  in  this  effort  we  are  certain  of  success;  for  it  is  God  that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Phil, ii. 13.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  fact  of  this  certain  perseverance  is  distinctly  asserted  in Scripture. Believers are said to be "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation." 1 Pet. i. 5. Paul was confident that He who had begun a good work in them (the Philippians) will perform it (finish completely) until the day of Jesus Christ. Phil. i. 6. Jesus said, "I give unto  them  (my  sheep)  eternal  life;  and  they  shall  never  perish, neither  shall  any  man  pluck  them  out  of  my  hand."  John  x.  28; Rom.xi 29 .</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The ground of this certain perseverance is not at all in the free will of the saints, but altogether -- (1.) In the inherent immutability of the eternal  decree  of  election.  We  saw,  under  chapter  iii.,  that  God's</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>decree  of  election  (a.)  respects  individuals;  (b.)  chooses  them  to salvation and all the means thereof; (c.) is not conditioned on the use he foresees they will make of grace, but is founded on " the counsel of his  own  will;"  (d.)  is  immutable  and  certainly  efficacious.  Essence those elected to salvation through grace must persevere in grace unto salvation.</p>
<p>The ground of the certainty of the perseverance of saints is also laid -  (2.)  In  the  provisions  of  the  eternal  covenant  of  grace.  We  saw, under  chapter  vii.,  that the Scriptures  teach  that  there  was  a covenant or personal counsel from eternity between the Father and the  Son,  as  the  Surety  of  the  elect,  determining  explicitly  (a.)  who were to be saved; (b.) what Christ was to do and suffer in order to save them; (c.) as to how and when the redemption of Christ was to be personally applied to them; (d.) as to all the advantages embraced in their salvation, etc. Hence  it  follows  necessarily that those embraced  in  this  covenant  cannot  fail  of  the  benefits  provided  for them. "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." John x. 29.</p>
<p>This  certainty  is  grounded  --  (3.)  In  the  merits  and  intercession  of Christ.  We  saw,  under  chapter  viii.,  that  the  Scriptures  teach  that Christ,  by  his  vicarious  obedience  and  suffering  as  their  federal representative,  wrought  out  a  perfect  righteousness  in  the  stead  of his people  -which  people  were  all  individually  and  certainly designated in the eternal covenant in pursuance of which he acted; and that he makes effectual intercession in heaven for all those, and for  those  only,  for  whom  he  hath  purchased  redemption.  Since, therefore, neither Christ's redemption nor his intercession can fail of the ends for which they are designed, it is evidently impossible that those  for  whom  he  was  substituted,  and  for  whom  he  acquired  a perfect righteousness, and for whom he offers an effectual intercession, can fail of salvation.</p>
<p>The certainty of the perseverance of the saints in grace is se cured -(4.) By the constant indwelling of the Holy Ghost. He acts upon the soul  in  perfect  accordance  with  the  laws  of  its  constitution  as  a rational and moral agent, and yet so as to secure the ultimate victory of the new spiritual principles and tendencies implanted in regeneration. John xiv. 16, 17; 1 John iii. 9.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The contents of the third proposition taught in this chapter should be examined carefully in connection with the proof-texts annexed to the several clauses. They need not be further illusitrated by us, since all  therein  contained is  a  matter  of  plain  meaning  and  of  universal experience. Observe the cases of David (2 Sam. xi. 2 -- 4; Ps. li.) and of Peter (Luke xxii. 54 -- 62). The perseverance of believers in grace is  wrought by the Holy Ghost, not irrespective of, but through, the free will of the man himself. Therefore it is a duty as well as a grace. The  grace  of  it  should  be  preached  for  the  encouragement  of  the diligent. The duty, and absolute necessity of it to salvation, should be preached  to  quicken  the  slothful  and  to  increase  the  sense  of obligation felt by all.</li>

<p>I. Although  hypocrites  and  other  unregenerate  men  may  vainly deceive  themselves  with  false  hopes  and  carnal  presumptions  of being in the favor of God, and estate of salvation[1] (which hope of theirs  shall  perish):[2]  yet  such  as  truly  believe  in  the  Lord  Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may, in this life, be certainly assured that they are in the state  of  grace,[3]  and  may  rejoice  in  the  hope  of  the  glory  of  God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.[4]</p>

<p>II.

<p>THESE sections teach the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There  is  a  false  assurance  of  salvation  which  unregenerate  men sometimes indulge,  in  which  they  are  deceived  and  which  shall  be finally disappointed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There  is,  on  the  other  hand,  a  true  assurance,  amounting  to  an infallible certainty, which sincere believers may entertain as to their own personal salvation, which shall not be confounded.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This infallible assurance of faith rests -- (1.) Upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation. (2.) Upon the inward evidence of those graces  unto  which  those  promises  are  made.  (3.)  The  testimony  of the  Spirit  of  adoption,  witnessing  with  our  spirits  that  we  are  the children of God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  unregenerate  men,  beguiled  by  the  natural desire for happiness,  flattered  by  self-love,  and  betrayed  by  a  spirit  of  selfrighteousness  and  self-confidence,  should  frequently  indulge  an unfounded  assurance  of  their  own  gracious  condition,  is  rendered antecedently  probable  from  what  we  know  of  human  nature,  and rendered certain as a fact from common observation and from the declarations of Scripture. Micah iii.11; Job viii. 13, 14.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>True assurance, however, may be distinguished from  that  which  is false  by  the  following tests: -- (1.) True assurance begets unfeigned humility; false assurance begets spiritual pride. 1 Cor. xv. 10; Gal. vi. 14.  (2.)  The  true  leads  to  increased  diligence  in  the  practice  of holiness; the false leads to sloth and self-indulgence. Ps. li. 12, 13, 19.</p>
<p>(3.) The true leads to candid self-examination and to a desire to be searched and corrected by God; the false leads to a disposition to be satisfied  with  appearance  and  to  avoid  accurate  investigation.  Ps. cxxxix. 23, 24. (4.) The true leads to constant aspirations after more intimate fellowship with God. 1 John iii. 2, 3.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That true believers may in this life attain to a certainty with regard to their own personal relations to Christ, and that this certainty is not a  bare  conjectural  and  probable  persuasion  founded  on  a  fallible hope, but an infallible assurance of faith, is proved from the fact -(1.) That it is directly affirmed in Scripture: " The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God." Rom. viii. 16. " hereby  we  do  know  that  we  know  him,  if  we  keep  his commandments." 1 John ii. 3. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren." 1 John iii. 14. (2.) The attainment  of  it  is  commanded  as  a  duty  in  Scripture.  We  are exhorted "to shew the same diligence to the full  assurance  of  hope unto the end," (Heb. vi. 11); and to "give diligence to make our calling and election sure, for if we do these things we shall never fall." 2 Pet. i.  10.  (3.)  There are examples of its attainment by ancient believers recorded in Scripture. Thus Paul: "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able," etc. " I have fought a good fight,...... I have  kept  the  faith:  henceforth  there  is  laid  up  for  me  a  crown  of righteousness," etc. 2 Tim. i. 12; iv. 7, 8; -- and John; 1 John ii. 3; iv. 16. (4.) There have been unquestionable instances in modern times in  which  sincere  Christians  have  enjoyed  a  full  assurance  of  their personal salvation, and in which their entire lives have vindicated the genuineness of their faith. The Protestant Reformers as a class were eminent  examples  of  the  possession  of  this  assurance.  God  had qualified them for their great work with an extraordinary measure of this grace. Their controversy with the Romanists also led them to lay great stress upon the duty of this attainment, even going so far as to identify  assurance  with  faith,  making  it  essential  to  salvation.  The Romanists held that faith is mere intellectual assent to the truth, not involving  trust;  and  that  hence  faith  has  nothing  to  do  with  the judgment any one makes of his own personal salvation; and hence that no one could attain to any certainty upon that point in this life without an extraordinary revelation. Council of Trent, sess. vi., ch. ix. The Reformers, on the other hand, went so far as to teach that the special  object  of  justifying  faith  is  the  favour  of  God  toward  us  for Christ's  sake:  therefore  to  believe  is  to  be  assured  of  our  own personal  salvation.  Thus  Luther,  Melancthon,  and  Calvin  taught. This is the doctrine taught in the Augsburg Confession and Heidelberg Catechism. It is not, however, taught in any other of the Reformed Confessions, and, as will be seen below, is not the Doctrine of our Standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This infallible assurance of faith rests (1.) upon the divine truth of the promises of salvation. Although it is one thing to be assured that the  promise  is  true,  and  another  thing  to  be  assured  of  our  own personal  interest  in  it,  yet  assurance  of  the  truth  of  the  promise tends, in connection  with  a  sense  of  our  personal  reliance  upon  it, directly to strengthen our assured hope that it will be fu1filled in our case also. Therefore God confirmed his promise by an oath, " That by two immutable things" (his promise and his oath), " in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us in the gospel " Heb. vi. 18. Thus faith includes trust. Trust rests upon the divine  truth  of  the  promises,  and  in  turn  supports  hope;  and  the fullness  of  hope  is  assurance.  This  assurance  rests  (2.)  upon  the inward evidence of those graces unto which the promises are made. Thus  the  Scriptures  promise  that  whosoever  believes  shall  have everlasting life. The believer whose faith is vigorous and intelligent has a distinct evidence in his own consciousness that he for one does believe. Hence the conclusion is obvious that he shall have everlasting life. The same promise is given to all who love God, to all who keep his commandments, to all who love the brethren, to the pure in heart, to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, etc. Hence, when these graces are possessed in such a degree, strength, and  purity,  that  we  are  conscious  of  their  genuineness,  then  the conclusion is immediate and irresistible, that we are in union with Christ,  and  have  a  right  to  appropriate  the  promises  to  ourselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This assurance  rests (3.) upon  the  testimony  of  the  Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God. This  language  is  taken  from  Rom.  viii.  16.  The  sense  in  which  this witnessing of the Holy Spirit to our spirits is to be understood has been much debated among theologians.</p>
<p>Some have maintained that the passage teaches that the Holy Spirit in some mysterious way directly reveals to our spirits the fact that we are the children of God, as one man immediately conveys information  to  another  man.  The  objections  to  this  view  are,  that Christians are not, and cannot be, conscious of any such injection of information  from  without  into  the  mind,  and  that,  as  far  as  such testimony  alone  is  concerned,  we  would  be  unable  to  distinguish certainly the testimony of the Spirit from the conclusions of our own reasons or the suggestions of our own hearts. An expectation of such direct communications would be likely to generate enthusiasm and presumption. Some have maintained, on the opposite extreme, that the  Spirit  witnesses  with  our  spirits  only  indirectly,  through  the evidence afforded by the graces he has formed within us. The true view appears to be, that the witness of the Spirit to our spirits that we are the children of God comprehends a number of particulars, all of which  are  confined  by  the  Spirit  to  this  end.  (1.)  The  Spirit  is  the author of  the  promises  of  Scripture,  and  of  the  marks  of  character indicating the persons to which the promises belong. (2.) The Spirit is the author of the graces of the saints, corresponding to the marks of character which  are  associated with these promises  in the Scripture. (3) The Spirit gives to the true believer, especially to the Christian eminent  for diligence and faithfulness, the grace of spiritual  illumination,  that  he  may  possess  a  keen  insight  into  his own character, that he may judge truly of the genuineness of his own graces, that he may rightly interpret the promises and the characters to which they are limited in the Scriptures; so that, comparing the outward standard with the inward experience, he may draw correct and  unquestionable  conclusions.  (4.)  The  Holy  Spirit  is  the  direct author  of  faith  in  all  its  degrees,  as  also  of  love  and  hope.  Full assurance, therefore -- which is the fullness of hope resting on the fullness of faith -- is a state of mind which it is the office of the Holy Ghost to induce in our minds in connection with the evidence of our gracious character above stated. In whatever way he works in us to will and to do of his own good pleasure (Phil. ii. 13), or sheds abroad the  love  of  God  in  our  hearts  (Rom.  v.  5),  or  begets  us  again  to  a lively hope (1 Pet. i. 3), in that way he gives origin to the grace of full assurance -- not as a blind and fortuitous feeling, but as a legitimate and  undoubting  conclusion  from  appropriate  evidence.  (5.)  The presence of the Holy Spirit is the first installment of the benefits of Christ's redemption, granted to those for whom they were purchased, and  therefore  the  pledge  and  earnest  of  the  completion  of  that redemption in due time. Thus Paul says of the Ephesians: " In whom also  (Christ),  after  that  ye  believed,  ye  were  sealed  with  that  Holy Spirit  of  promise,  which  is  the  earnest  of  our  inheritance  until  the redemption  of  the  purchased  possession."  Eph.  i.  13,  14;  iv.  30;  1 John ii. 20, 27; 2 Cor. i.22; v. 5</p>
<p>III.  This  infallible  assurance  doth  not  so  belong  to  the  essence  of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it:[10] yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means, attain thereunto.[11] And therefore it is the duty of everyone to give all  diligence  to  make  his  calling  and  election  sure,[12]  that  thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, in love and  thankfulness  to  God,  and  in  strength  and  cheerfulness  in  the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance;[13] so far is it from inclining men to looseness.[14]</p>

<p>IV.  True  believers  may  have  the  assurance  of  their salvation divers ways  shaken,  diminished,  and  intermitted;  as,  by  negligence  in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin which woundeth the conscience  and  grieveth  the  Spirit;  by  some  sudden  or  vehement temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness and to have no light:[15] yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life  of  faith,  that  love  of  Christ  and  the  brethren,  that  sincerity  of heart, and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit,  this  assurance  may,  in  due  time,  be  revived;[16]  and  by  the which, in the meantime, they are supported from utter despair.[17]</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>These sections teach: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this infallible assurance is not of the essence of faith; that, on the contrary, a man may be a true believer and yet destitute of this assurance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  being,  nevertheless,  as  taught  in  the  preceding  sections, attainable in this life in the use of ordinary means,  without extraordinary revelation, it is consequently the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure; because this assurance, instead of inclining men to negligence, tends properly to increase  (1.)  spiritual  peace  and  joy,  (2.)  love  and  thankfulness  to God, and (3.) strength and cheerfulness in the works of obedience.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>True  believers,  after  having  attained  this  assurance,  may  have  it shaken,  diminished,  and  intermitted:  the  causes  or  occasions  of which are such as -- (1.)  negligence  in  preserving  this  grace  in  full exercise;  (2.)  falling  into  some  special  sin;  (3.)  some  sudden  and vehement temptations; (4.) God's temporary withdrawing of the light of his countenance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>nevertheless,  since,  as  was  shown  under  chapter  xvii.,  no  true believer is ever permitted totally to fall away from grace, he is never left entirely without any token of God's favour; and, the root of faith remaining, this assurance may in due time be revived.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this infallible assurance is not of the essence of saving faith is affirmed over and  over again in our Standards, and  is true. Assurance, in one degree or another of it, is of the essence of faith, because  just  in  proportion  to  the  strength  of  our  faith  is  our assurance of the truth of that which we believe; but since true faith exists in very various degrees of strength, and since its exercises are sometimes intermitted, it follows that the assurance which accompanies true faith is not always a full assurance. Conf. Faith, ch. xiv., section 8; L. Cat., q. 81.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides this, the phrase full or " infallible assurance," in this chapter, does not relate to the certainty of our faith or trust as to the truth of the object upon which the faith rests -- that is, the divine promise of salvation in Christ -- but to the certainty of our hope or belief as to our own personal relation to Christ and eternal salvation. Hence it follows that while assurance, in some degree of it, does belong to the essence of all real faith in the sufficiency of Christ and the truth of the promises, it is not in any degree essential to a genuine faith that the believer should be persuaded of the truth of his own experience and the safety of his estate. Theologians consequently have distinguished between the assurance of faith (Heb. x. 22) -- that is, a strong  faith  as  to  the  truth  of  Christ  --  and  the  assurance  of  hope (Heb. vi. 11) -- that is, a certain persuasion that we are true believers, and therefore safe. This latter is also called the assurance of sense, because it rests upon the inward sense the soul has of the reality of its own spiritual experiences. The first is of the essence of faith, and terminates directly upon Christ and his promise; and hence is called the direct act of faith. The latter is not of the essence of faith, but is its fruit; and is called the reflex act of faith, because it is drawn as an inference from the experience of the graces of the Spirit which the soul discerns when it reflects upon its own consciousness. God says that whosoever believes is saved -- that is the object of direct faith: I believe -- that is the matter of conscious experience: therefore I am saved  --  that  is  the  matter  of  inference  and  the  essence  of  full assurance.</p>
<p>That  this  full  assurance  of  our  own  gracious  state  is  not  of  the essence of saving faith is proved -- (1.) From the form in which the offer of salvation in Christ -- which is the object of saving faith -- is set  forth  in  the  Scriptures:  "Believe  on  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  and thou shalt be saved;" " whosoever will, let him take," etc.; "Him that cometh to me, I wi11 in no wise cast out." Acts xvi. 31; Rev. xxii. 1 7; John vi. 37. The matter revealed, and therefore the truth accepted by faith, is, not that God is reconciled to me in Christ, but that Christ is presented to me as the foundation of truth, and will save me if I do truly trust. It is evident that trust itself is something different from the certainty that we do trust, and that our trust is of the right kind. (2.) All the promises of the Bible are made to classes -- to believers, to saints, etc. -- and not to individuals. (3.) Paul appeared to doubt as to the genuineness of his faith long after he was a true believer. (4.) As we saw above, the Bible contains many exhortations addressed to believers to go on to the grace of full assurance, as something beyond their  present  attainments.  Heb.  x.  22;  vi.  11;  2  Pet.  i.  10.  (5.)  The experience of the great body of God's people in modern times proves the same thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since this infallible assurance is not of the essence of faith, but its fruit, and one of the highest attainments of the divine life; and since it may be attained in this life in the use of ordinary means, without extraordinary revelation -- it follows necessarily that its attainment is a duty as well as a grace, that all that leads to it should be diligently sought,  and  that  all  that  prevents  it  should  be  carefully  avoided. Genuine assurance cannot lead to looseness and indifference in the cultivation of grace and the performance of religious duties, since its very existence  depends  -(1.) Upon  the  evidence  afforded  by diligence in those duties, and by the strength of those graces, that we are true believers; and (2.) Upon the approving witness of the Holy</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spirit.  As  we  have  seen above, under sections i. and ii., a false and presumptuous  assurance  is  to  be  discriminated  from  a  genuine assurance by certain clear, practical marks. On the contrary, genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these, from the very laws of our  being,  to  greater  buoyancy,  strength,  and  cheerfulness  in  the practice of obedience in every department of duty. It hence follows that every principle of self-interest and every obligation resting upon us as Christians conspire to induce us to use all diligence in seeking the full attainment and the abiding enjoyment of this grace.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since  this  assurance  rests  upon  the  consciousness  of  gracious experiences and the witness of the Holy Ghost; and as we have seen, under chapters xiii. and xvii., that true Christians may temporarily, though never totally, fall from the exercise of grace; and since these exercises  in  this  life  are  never  perfect  and  unmixed  with  carnal elements -- it necessarily follows that the assurance which rests upon them must be subject to be shaken, diminished, and intermitted in divers  ways.  (1.)  Since  it  is  a  duty  as  well  as  a  grace,  it  must  be imperiled by any want of diligence in preserving it in full exercise. (2.)  Since  it  rests  upon  the  consciousness  of  gracious  exercises,  it must be marred, if not intermitted, by any notable fall into sin which grieves the Holy Spirit and wounds the conscience, thus clouding the sense of forgiveness and diminishing the evidence of grace. (3.) The same may evidently be effected by some vehement temptation. (4.) The same effect may be produced by God's withdrawing the light of his countenance, in the way of fatherly discipline, for the purpose of trying  our  faith,  of  convincing  us  of  our  entire  dependence,  and  of the all-sufficiency of his gracious help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the true believer may fall into sin, but may never fall totally from grace, it is self-evident, as taught in these sections, that he may lose  the  exercise  of  full  assurance,  but  that  he  cannot  lose  the principle from which it springs; and that hence, through the blessing of  God  upon  the  diligent  use  of  the  appropriate  means,  it  may  be strengthened when weakened and recovered when lost.</p>

<p>SECTION: I. God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of  works,  by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and  perpetual  obedience,  promised  life  upon  the  fulfilling,  and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.[1]</p>

<p>SECTION: II. This law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness; and, as such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in  ten  commandments,  and  written  in  two  tables:[2]  the  first  four commandments containing our duty towards God; and the other six, our duty to man.[3]</p>

<li>
<ol>
<li>Exod. 30:3-17; Matt. 22:37-40 These sections teach the following propositions: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  God,  as  the  supreme  moral  Governor  of  the  universe, introduced  the  human  race  into  existence  as  an  order  of  moral creatures,  under  inalienable  and  perpetual  subjection  to  an  allperfect  moral  law,  which  in  all  the  elements  thereof  binds  man's' conscience and requires perfect obedience.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  God,  as  the  Guardian  of  the  human  race,  entered  into  a special covenant  with  Adam,  as  the  natural  head  of  the  race, constituting him also the federal head of all mankind, and requiring from him, during a period of probation, perfect obedience to the law above  named,  promising  to  him  and  to  his  descendants  in  him confirmation  in  holiness  and  eternal felicity as the reward  of obedience, and threatening both his wrath and curse as the punishment of disobedience.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This law after the fall, and the introduction of the dispensation of salvation through the messiah, while it ceased to offer salvation  on the ground of obedience, nevertheless continued to be the revealed expression of God's will, binding all human consciences as the rule of life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  this  moral  law  has  for  our  instruction  been  summarily comprehended, as to its general principles, in their application to the main  relations  men  sustain  to  God  and  to  each  other,  in  the  Ten Commandments, " which were delivered by the voice of God upon Mount  Sinai,  and  written  by  him  in  two  tables  of  stone;  and  are recorded in the 20th chapter of Exodus. The first four commandments containing our duty to God, and the other six our duty to man." L. Cat., q. 98.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God  introduced  man  at  his  creation  as  a  moral  agent,  under. inalienable  and  perpetual  subjection  to  an  all-perfect  moral  law, which  binds  his  conscience  and  requires  perfect  obedience.  This</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>follows self-evidently and necessarily from the very nature of God as a moral Governor, and from the nature of man as a moral agent.</p>
<h2 id="of-this-law-we-remark-">Of this law we remark --<a class="headerlink" href="#of-this-law-we-remark-" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>(1.) That it has its ground in the all-perfect and unchangeable moral nature of God. When we affirm that God is holy, we do not mean that he  makes  right  to  be  right  by  simply  willing  it,  but  that  he  wills  it because it is right. There must therefore be some absolute standard of  righteousness.  This  absolute  standard  of  righteousness  is  the divine  nature.  The  infallible  judge  of  righteousness  is  the  divine intelligence.  The  a11-perfect  executor  and  rule  of  righteousness among the creatures is the divine will. The form of our duties springs from  our  various  relations  to  God  and  to  man;  but  the  invariable principle  upon  which  all  duty  is  grounded,  and  which  gives  it  its binding moral obligation, is rooted in the changeless nature of God, of which his will is the outward expression. All the divine laws belong to one or other of four classes. They are either --</li>
<li>(a.)  Such  as  are  grounded  directly  in  the  perfections  of  the  divine nature, and are hence absolutely immutable and irrepealable even by God himself.  These  are,  such  as  the  duty  of  love  and  obedience  to God, and of love and truth in our relations to our fellow-creatures. Or,--</li>
<li>(b.) Such as have their immediate ground in the permanent Nature and  relations  of  men;  as,  for  instance,  the  laws  which  protect  the rights  of  property  and  regulate  the  relation  of  the  sexes.  These continue  unchanged  as  long  as  the  present  constitution  of  nature continues, and are of universal binding obligation, alike because of their natural propriety as because of the will of God by which they are  enforced;  although  God,  who  is  the  author  of  nature,  may  in special instances waive the application of the law at his pleasure, as he did in the case of polygamy among the ancient Jews. Or,--</li>
<li>(c.) Such as have their immediate ground in the changing relations of individuals and communities. Of this class are the great mass of the</li>
</ul>
<p>civil  and  judicial  laws  of  the  ancient  Jew,  which express the will of God for them in their peculiar circumstances, and which of course are intended to be binding only so long as the special conditions to which they are appropriate exist. Or,--</p>
<ul>
<li>(d.) Such as depend altogether for their binding obligation upon the positive command of God, which are neither universal nor perpetual, but bind those persons only to whom God has addressed them, and only so long as the positive enactment endures. This class includes all rites and ceremonies, etc.</li>
<li>(2.) We remark in the second place that this moral law, at least in its essential principles, and as far as was necessary for the guidance of men in a state of innocency, was revealed in the very constitution of man's  nature;  and  although  it  has  been  greatly  obscured  by  sin,  it remains sufficiently clear to render even the heathen without excuse. This is certain -- (a.) Because it is asserted and argued by Paul (Rom. i. 19, 20; ii. 14, 15); (b.) From the fact that all heathen do possess and act upon such an innate sense of right and of moral accountability, although they may in various degrees be ignorant of specific moral duties.  This  moral  law  written  upon  the  heart  was  part  of  Adam's original endowment when he was created, as we saw under chapter iv., section 2.</li>
<li>(3.) We remark that the revelation of this moral law of God made in the human constitution, however sufficient it may have been for the guidance of man before he fell, in the natural relations he sustained to his Creator, is under his present circumstances altogether insufficient,  as  we  saw  under  chapter  i.,  section  1.  Hence  God  has been pleased to make a more full and explicit revelation of his law to man in the inspired Scriptures taken as a whole, which is the only and  the  all-sufficient  rule  of  faith  and  practice,  as  we  saw  under chapter i.</li>
<li>(4.) We remark in the fourth place that the Scriptures being the only and  a  complete  rule  of  faith  and  practice,  whatever  is  revealed</li>
</ul>
<p>therein as the will of God is part of the moral law for Christian men; and whatever is not revealed therein as his will, either directly or by necessary implication, is no part of our moral obligation at all. See chapter xvi., sections 1 and 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God introduced Adam, as the head and representative of the whole human family, at his creation, into a covenant relation to the law,  making  perfect  obedience  to  it  for  a  probationary  period  the condition  of  his  character  and  destiny  for  ever,  we  have  already discussed, chapter vii., sections1 and 2. After the fall of Adam, both he  and  all  his  race  became  incapable  of  satisfying  that  covenant themselves, and it pleased God to send forth his Son, made under the law,  being  born  of  a  woman,  to  fulfil  as  the  second  Adam  all  the requirements  of  the  legal  covenant  in  behalf  of  his  elect,  and  to secure for them all its benefits, as we saw under chapter viii.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>While  the  law  in  its  relation  of  a  covenant  of  works  has  been fulfilled by our Surety, so that they who are under grace are no more under the law in that capacity (Rom. vi. 14), nevertheless the law as a rule of action and standard of character is immutable, unrelaxable, and inalienable, in its personal relations. Christ fulfilled the law for us vicariously as the condition of salvation, and on that basis we are justified. But no one can be vicariously conformed to the law for us as  a  rule  of  conduct  or  of  moral  character.  Therefore,  while  Christ fulfilled  the  law  for  us,  the  Holy  Spirit  fulfils  the  law  in  us,  by sanctifying  us  into  complete  conformity  to  it.  And  in  obedience  to this  law  the  believer  brings  forth  those  good  works  which  are  the fruits though not the ground of our salvation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That this moral law has been summarily comprehended in the two tables  of  the  law,  called  the  Ten  Commandments,  is  a  fact  not disputed.  By  this  it  is  not  meant  that  every  duty  which  God  now requires of Christian men  may  be directly derived from the Decalogue, but that the general principles of the infinite law of moral perfection, as adjusted to the general relations sustained by men to</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>God and to one another, may be found there. This is certain, because --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  The  two  tables  of  the  law  were  placed  under  the  mercy-seat, which  was  God's  throne,  and  were  called  the  testimonies  of  God against the sins of the people; and over them, upon the " covering" or mercy-seat,  the  high  priest  sprinkled  the  blood  of  the  sin-offering. Deut. x. 1 --  5;  Ex.  xxx.  6;  xxxi.  18;  Lev.  xvi.  14,  l5.  They  therefore represented  that all-perfect law of righteousness which  is the foundation  of  God's  throne,  and  which  is  the  testimony  of  God against human sin, and which is propitiated by the atoning sacrifice of Christ.</li>
<li>(2.) The Ten Commandments teach love to God and to man; and on these, the Saviour said, hang all the Law and the Prophets. Matt. xxii. 37 -- 40.</li>
<li>(3.) Christ said, that if a man keep this law he shall live. Luke x.-25 -28.</li>
<li>(4.) Every specific duty taught in any portion of the Scriptures may more  or  less  directly  be  referred  to  one  or  other  of  the  general precepts taught in the Decalogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>These commandments were originally written by the finger of God himself on two tables of stone. The first four relate to the duties man owes to God, and the remaining six relate to the duties we owe to our fellow-men. The Romish Church assigns only three commandments to  the  first  table,  and  seven  to  the  second.  She  unites  the  first  and second  commandments  together,  in  order  to  make  it  appear  that only the worship of false gods and images of them is forbidden, while the images of the true God and of saints are not excluded from the instruments  of  worship;  and,  in  order  to  keep  up  the  number,  she divides  the  tenth  into  two  --  making  the  first  clause  the  ninth commandment, and the remaining clauses the tenth.</p>
<p>The great rule for interpreting the Decalogue is to keep constantly in mind  that  it  is  the  law  of  God,  and  not  the  law  of  man  --  that  it respects and requires the conformity of the governing affections and dispositions  of  the  heart  as  well  as  of  the  outward  actions.  Every commandment  involves  a  general  moral  principle,  applicable  to  a wide  variety  of  particular  conditions,  respecting  the  motives  and ends of action, as well as action itself The rules of interpretation laid down in the L. Cat., q. 99, are in substance as follows: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) The law is perfect, requiring perfect obedience, and condemning the least shortcoming as sin.</li>
<li>(2.) It is spiritual, respecting thoughts, feelings, motives, and inward states of hearts, as well as actions.</li>
<li>(3.)  That  every  command implies a corresponding prohibition,  and every  prohibition  a  corresponding  command;  and  every  promise  a corresponding  threatening,  and  every  threatening  a  corresponding promise.</li>
<li>(4.) That under one sin or duty all of the same kind are forbidden or commanded,  together  with  all  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are  the causes or occasions of them.</li>
<li>(5.) That we are not only bound to fulfil the law ourselves, but also to help others to do so as far as we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION:  III.  Beside  this  law,  commonly  called  moral,  God  was pleased  to  give  to  the  people  of  Israel,  as  a  church  under  age, ceremonial  laws,  containing  several  typical  ordinances,  partly  of worship,  prefiguring  Christ,  his graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits;[4]  and  partly,  holding  forth  divers  instructions  of  moral duties.[5] All which ceremonial  laws  are  now  abrogated,  under  the new testament.[6]</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections teach: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That besides the moral law summarily expressed in the Decalogue, God gave the Jews a ceremonial law, wherein, by means of types and symbols,  (1,)  Christ  and  his  work  were  set  forth,  and  (2.)  certain moral truths inculcated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That he also gave to them, as a body politic, a system of judicial laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That both the ceremonial and judicial laws of the Jews have ceased to have any binding force under the Christian economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  on  the  other  hand  the  moral  law  continues  of  unabated authority, not only because its elements are intrinsically binding, but</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>because, also, of the authority of God, who still continues to enforce it. And  Christ, instead of lessening, has greatly increased the obligation to fulfil it.</p>
<p>We have already stated, under the preceding sections of this chapter, the principles which  distinguish  the  different  classes  of  divine commands.</p>
<p>Those  commands  which  have  their  ground  or  reason  either  in  the essential principles of the divine nature or in the permanent constitution  of  things,  of  course  have  not  been  abrogated  by  the introduction  of  the  Christian  dispensation.  On  the  contrary,  it  was precisely  the  law  of  perfect  moral  rectitude  that  Christ  vicariously fulfilled as our representative, and thus became "the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." Rom. x. 4. Christ also redeemed his people "from all iniquity," that they might be "zealous of good works" (Tit. ii. 14); and we have seen under chapter xvi. that those only are good works which are done in obedience to the law. By redemption,  also,  Christ  has  brought  his  people  under  new  and higher obligations to obedience; he furnishes new motives, and in the graces  of  regeneration  and  sanctification  he  communicates  to  the soul new powers and encouragements for the same. Some of these original laws, founded on the constitution of things, God was pleased under the Mosaic dispensation to relax to a degree, as in the case of marriage and divorce; but in every case the original law, instead of being  abrogated,  has  been  restored  to  its  pristine  breadth  and authority  by  Christ  and  his  apostles.  The  Sermon  on  the  Mount, recorded in the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of Matthew, is an example of the manner in which the spirit of Christianity exalts and expands the letter of the law beyond any revelation of it which had previously been made.</p>
<p>The principles by which we are to determine what element of the law enacted under the old dispensation is abrogated, and what element remains in full force under the new dispensation, are the following: -</p>
<p>-</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) When the continued obligation of any commandment is asserted or  practically  recognized in the New Testament, it is plain  that  the change  of  dispensations  has  made  no  change  in  the  law.  Thus  the provisions  of  the  moral  law  are  constantly  recognized  in  the  New Testament.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  enactment  is  explicitly repealed,  or  its  abrogation  implied  by  what  is  taught  in  the  New Testament, the case is also made plain.</li>
<li>(2.)  Where  there  is  no  direct  information  upon  the  question  to  be gathered  from  the  New  Testament,  a  careful  examination  of  the reason of  the  law  will  afford  us  good  ground  of  judgment  as  to  its perpetuity. If the original reason for its enactment is universal and permanent, and the law has never been explicitly repealed, then the law abides in force. If the reason of the law is transient, its binding force is transient also.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mosaic institute may be viewed in three different aspects: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) As a national and  political covenant, whereby,  under  his theocratic government, the Israelites became the people of Jehovah and he became their King, and in which the Church and the State are identical.</li>
<li>(2.) In another aspect it was a legal covenant, because the moral law, obedience to which was the condition of life in the Adamic covenant, was now prominently set forth in the Ten Commandments and made the  basis  of  the  new  covenant  of  God  with  his  people.  Even  the ceremonial system, in its merely literal and apart from its ceremonial aspect, was a rule of works; for cursed was he that confirmed not all the words of the law to do them. Deut.. xxvii. 26.</li>
<li>(3.)  It contained  also  an  elaborate  system  of  symbols,  wherein spiritual truths were significantly set forth by outward visible signs, the vast majority of which were types, or prophetic symbols, setting forth the person  and  work  of  Christ and  the benefits of his redemption.</li>
</ul>
<p>That the ceremonial law introduced by Moses was typical of Christ and his work is taught throughout the New Testament, and especially in  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  It  was  declared  to  be  a  "shadow  of things  to  come,  but  the  body  is  of  Christ."  The  tabernacle  and  its services  were  "patterns  of  things  in  the  heavens,"  and  figures, antitypes, of the true tabernacle, into which Christ has now entered for us. Col. ii. 17; Heb. ix. 23, 24. Christ is said to have effected our salvation by offering himself as a sacrifice and by acting as our high priest. Eph. v. 2; Heb. ix. 11, 12, 26, 28; xiii. 11, 12. That the coming of Christ has superseded and for ever done away with the ceremonial law is also evident from the very fact just stated -- that its ceremonies were types of him, that they were the shadows of which he was the substance. Their whole purpose and design were evidently discharged as soon as his real work of satisfaction was accomplished; and therefore it is not only a truth taught in Scripture (Heb. x. 1 -- 14; Col. ii. 14 -- 17; Eph. ii. 15, 16), but an undeniable historical fact, that the priestly work of Christ immediately and definitely superseded the work  of  the  Levitical  priest.  The  instant  of  Christ's  death,  the  veil separating the throne of God from the approach of men "was rent in twain from the top to the bottom" (Matt. xxvii. 50, 51), thus throwing the way open to all, and dispensing with priests and their ceremonial for ever.</p>
<p>That  the  judicial  laws  of  the  Jews  have  ceased  to  have  binding obligation  upon  us  follows  plainly,  from  the  fact  that  the  peculiar relations  of  the  people  to  God  as  theocratical  King,  and  to  one another  as  fellow-members  of  an  Old  Testament  Church  State,  to which these laws were adjusted, now no longer exist.</p>
<p>SECTION:  VI.  Although  true  believers  be  not  under  the  law,  as  a covenant of works, to be thereby justified, or condemned;[11] yet is it of  great  use  to  them,  as  well  as  to  others;  in  that,  as  a  rule  of  life informing them of the will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk accordingly;[12] discovering also the sinful pollutions of  their  nature,  hearts,  and  lives;[13]  so  as,  examining  themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin,[14] together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience.[15] It is likewise of  use  to  the  regenerate,  to  restrain  their  corruptions,  in  that  it forbids sin:[16] and the threatenings of it serve to show  what  even their sins deserve; and what afflictions, in this life, they may expect for  them,  although  freed  from  the  curse  thereof  threatened  in  the law.[17]  The  promises  of  it,  in  like  manner,  show  them  God's approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof:[18] although not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works.[19] So as, a man's doing good, and refraining from  evil,  because  the  law  encourageth  to  the  one,  and  deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law; and, not under grace.[20]</p>

<li>That  since  the  fall  no  man  is  able  to  attain  to  righteousness  and eternal  life  through  obedience  to  the  law.  This  is  beyond  question, because all men have sinned; because men's natures are depraved; because  the  law  demands  perfect  and  perpetual  obedience;  and because ." if  righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. ii. 21.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That those who have embraced the gospel of Christ are no longer under the law as a covenant of life, but under grace.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  nevertheless,  under  the  gospel  dispensation,  and  in  perfect harmony with its principles, the law is of manifold uses for all classes of men, and especially in the following respects: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) To all men generally the law is a revelation of the character and will  of  God,  a  standard  of  moral  excellence,  and  a  rule  for  the regulation of action.</li>
<li>(2.)  To  unregenerate men, considered in relation to the gospel, the law is of use to convince them of the holiness and justice of God, of their  own  guilt  and  pollution,  of  their  utter  inability  to  fulfil  its requirements,  and  so  to  act  as  a  schoolmaster  to  bring  them  to Christ. Rom. vii. 7 -- 13 Gal iii. 24.</li>
<li>(3) With respect to incorrigible sinners, the law is of use to restrain the  outbursts  of  their  evil  passions,  to  render  their  disobedience without excuse, to vindicate the justice of God in their condemnation, and to render their cases a warning to others. 1 Tim. i. 9; Rom. i. 20; ii. 15; John iii. 18, 3.</li>
<li>(4.) In respect to regenerate men, the law continues to be indispensable  as  the  instrument  of  the  Holy  Ghost  in  the  work  of their  sanctification.  It  remains  to  them  an  inflexible  standard  of righteousness,  to  which  their  nature  and  their  actions  ought  to correspond. It shows them the extent of their obligations to Christ, and  how  far  short,  as  yet,  they  are  from  having  apprehended  that</li>
</ul>
<p>whereunto they were apprehended in Christ Jesus. It thus tends to set  up  in  the  regenerate  the  habit  of  conviction  of  sin  and  of repentance  and  faith.  Its  threatenings  and  its  promises  present motives deterring from sin and assuring of grace, and thus leading the  soul  onward  to  that  blissful  attainment  when  the  sovereignly imposed law of God will become the spontaneous law of our spirits, and hence that royal law of liberty of which James speaks. James i. 25; ii. 8, 12. See L. Cat., qs. 94 -- 97.</p>

<p>SECTION: I. The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the gospel consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning  wrath  of  God,  the  curse  of  the  moral  law;[1]  and,  in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin;[2] from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the  victory  of  the  grave,  and  everlasting  damnation;[3]  as  also,  in their free access  to  God,[4]  and  their  yielding  obedience  unto  him, not out of slavish fear, but a childlike love and willing mind.[5] All which were common also to believers under the law.[6] But, under the  new  testament,  the  liberty  of  Christians  is  further  enlarged,  in their  freedom  from  the  yoke  of  the  ceremonial  law,  to  which  the Jewish church was subjected;[7] and in greater boldness of access to the  throne  of  grace,[8]  and  in  fuller  communications  of  the  free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.

<p>THE subject of this chapter is that liberty wherewith  Christ  makes his people free, which is very different from that freedom of the will which we discussed under chapter ix. We there saw that freedom of the  will  is  an  inalienable,  constitutional  faculty  of  the  human  soul, whereby it always exercises its volitions as upon the whole it pleases in any given case. This liberty of will is essential to free agency, and is possessed by all free agents, good or bad, or they could not be held accountable. Christian liberty, on the other hand, implies two things: -- (1.) Such an inward spiritual condition of soul that a man has full power  through  grace  to  desire  and  will  as  he  ought  to  do  in conformity to the law of God; and (2.) Such relations to God that the person  is  delivered  from  the  constraining  motives  of  fear,  and brought  under  the  ennobling  impulses  of  love  and  hope;  and  such relations  to  Satan  and  evil  men  that  he  is  delivered.  from  their coercive influences; and such providential circumstances that he has knowledge  of  his  privileges  and  gracious  aid  in  availing  himself  of them. This liberty involves the change of nature effectd in regeneration  and  perfected  in  sanctification,  and  the  change  of relation involved in justification. It is a main element in the grace of adoption, and a privilege of all the children of God. Rom. viii. 14, 15. It was purchased for us by Christ, and is therefore attributed to him (Gal.  v.  1);  it  is  applied  and  effectually  wrought  in  us  by  the  Holy Ghost, and therefore attributed to him. 2 Cor. iii. 17.</p>
<p>This section sets forth this precious and  most  comprehensive Christian grace in two orders; -- first, as it is common to all believers at  all  times;  and,  second,  as  it  is  enjoyed  pre-eminently  in  certain respects  by  believers  under  the  new  dispensation  in  contrast  to believers under the old.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  this  Christian  liberty  is  common to all believers in all ages, it consists mainly in the following particulars: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.)  They  are  delivered  from  the  guilt  of  sin  and  the  curse  of  the moral  law.  This  is  done,  as  we  saw  under  chapter  xi.,  when  the believer is justified, his guilt in strict rigour of justice cancelled, and all  the  demands of the law satisfied by crediting to his account the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ. The guilt of his sin having thus been actually extinguished, and the demands of the law having been perfectly satisfied, they can no longer hold him in bondage. "It is God that JUSTIFIETH: Who is he that condemneth?" Rom. viii. 33, 34.</li>
<li>(2.) They are delivered also from the bondage of sin as an inherent principle of their nature. This deliverance is commenced in regeneration, and is carried on and perfected in sanctification, as we saw under chapters x. and xiii. A law still remains in their members warring  against  the  law  of  their  mind,  and  bringing  them  into captivity to the law of sin which is in their members (Rom. vii. 23); nevertheless the indwelling Holy Spirit works with them to will and to do of his good pleasure, and thus secures them, upon the whole, the victory. See chapter xvii.</li>
<li>(3.) They thus have peace with God. This includes the two precious benefits of God's reconciliation to us through the propitiation of our High Priest, and our reconciliation to him through the work of the Holy Ghost. Thus we are delivered from that fear which hath torment and gendereth to bondage, and have that filial, submissive, confiding love shed abroad in our hearts which casteth out all fear. 1 John iv. 18.  The  Holy  Ghost  himself  is  the  earnest  of  our  inheritance,  and witnesseth with our spirits that we are the children of God. Rom. viii. 16. Thus having a High Priest over the house of God, we have great confidence  in  entering  into  the  very  holiest  through  the  new  and living way opened by Christ, where God makes the clearest revelations and fullest communications of his grace to his beloved.</li>
<li>(4.) They are delivered from the bondage of Satan and the dominating  influence  of  this  present  evil  world.  The  power  of  the "world."  and  the  "devil"  depends  upon  the  "flesh,"  or  the  corrupt state of the man's own heart. Christ "was in all points tempted like as we  are,  yet  without  sin."  Heb.  iv.  15.  The  act  of  justification  has consecrated  the  believer  to  God.  The  work  of  sanctification  breaks the power of temptation, God in every case either graciously enabling us to resist and come off conquerors, or providentially opening a way of escape for us. 1 Cor. x. 13. Thus Satan, too, is subject to his power; he helps us to resist Satan and put him to flight, and the excess of his malignant power he prevents and restrains.</li>
<li>(5.)  They  are  delivered  from  the  evil  of  afflictions  and  the  sting  of death. The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law, but Christ has delivered them from the curse of the law, being made a curse  for  them.  In  justification  the  believer's  relation  to  the  law  is permanently changed. It is no more the basis of his salvation. And death,  and  all  the  sorrows  incident  to  this  life,  which  are  the consequences of sin, which to the reprobate are parts of the penalty of sin inflicted in pursuance of law, to the true believers are elements of God's chastening grace, designed for their improvement. Heb. xii. 6 -- 11. By the death of Christ believers are delivered from the fear of death. Heb. ii. 14, 15.</li>
<li>(6.)  They  are  also  delivered  from  the  victory  of  the  grave  and everlasting damnation. The first effect of his redemption which the true believer sensibly experiences is the forgivenes of his sins. If his sins are forgiven, the penal consequences of them must be removed. "There  is  therefore  now  no  condemnation  to  them  which  are  in Christ  Jesus."  Rom.  viii.  1.  There  can  therefore  be  nothing  to  fear beyond  death.  Even  our  mortal  bodies  are  members  of  Christ  and temples  of  that  Holy  Ghost  who  will  quicken  them  and  transform them into  the  likeness  of  our  glorious  Redeemer.  1  Cor.  vi.  15,  19; Rom. viii. 11; Phil. iii. 21.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>In certain respects believers under the Gospel enjoy this Christian liberty in a higher degree than it was enjoyed by believers under the Old Testament: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) The New Testament believer is delivered from the obligation of the ceremonial law. This law was to the Old Testament believer the revelation  of the gospel  of  the  Son  of  God,  and  therefore  an inestimable  blessing;  but  it  was  comparatively  so  obscured  with material symbols and ceremonies, and enforced obedience so largely by coercive measures, that the apostle called the whole system " the elements  of  the  world,"  under  which  the  Jews  were  "  in  bondage" (Gal. iv. 3); a " yoke of bondage " (Gal. v. 1), and " carnal ordinances imposeed on them until the time of reformation." Heb. ix. 10. And in contrast therewith he exhorts the Christian Galatians to "stand fast in  the  liberty  wherewith  Christ  hath  made  us  free."  Gal.  v.  1.  We enjoy the clear light shed from the person and work of our adorable Redeemer in person. We have the direct instead of the reflected ray - immediate access to the Father instead of a constrained approach through the medium of priests and an outward sanctuary.</li>
<li>(2.) In connection with this, believers under the present dispensation have greater boldness in approaching God, and fuller communications  of  his  Spirit.  The  greater  boldness  now  enjoyed evidently results from the clearer and fuller revelation now enjoyed of  the  method  and  completeness  of  redemption  and  the  greater fulness in the communications of the Holy Ghost. This divine person, as we know, inspired the Old Testament prophets and sanctified the Old  Testament  saints;  nevertheless  the  new  dispensation  is  preeminently characterized by the clearness with which the truth with respect  to  the  office  of  the  Holy  Ghost  is  revealed  and  the  fulness with which his influence is dispensed. Christ promised the gift of the Holy  Ghost  in  this  pre-eminent  measure  of  it  after  his  ascension. John  xv.  26.  Previously  it  was  said,  "  The  Holy  Ghost  was  not  yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified." John vii. 39. After his  ascension,  on  the  great  day  of  Pentecost,  Peter  said  that  in fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecy (Isa. xliv.  3;  Ezek.  xxxvi. 27; Joel ii. 28, 29,) and the promise of Christ, " he being by the right</li>
</ul>
<p>hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear." Acts ii. 16, 17, 33.</p>
<p>SECTION: II. God alone is Lord of the conscience,[10] and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men, which are, in anything,  contrary  to  his  Word;  or  beside  it,  if  matters  of  faith,  or worship.[11]  So  that,  to  believe  such  doctrines,  or  to  obey  such commands, out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience: [12] and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience, and reason also.[13]</p>

<p>SECTION:  III.  They  who,  upon  pretense  of  Christian  liberty,  do practice any sin, or cherish any lust, do thereby destroy the  end  of Christian liberty, which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.[14]</p>

<p>IV.  And  because  the  powers  which  God  hath  ordained,  and  the liberty  which  Christ  hath  purchased,  are  not  intended  by  God  to destroy, but mutually to uphold and preserve one another, they who, upon pretense of Christian liberty, shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, resist the ordinance of God.[15] And, for their publishing of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices, as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of Christianity (whether concerning faith, worship,  or  conversation),  or  to  the  power  of  godliness;  or,  such erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in the manner of publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external  peace  and  order  which  Christ  hath  established  in  the church,  they  may  lawfully  be  called  to  account,  and  proceeded against, by the censures of the church.[16]</p>

</ol>
<p>These sections teach the following propositions: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God alone is Lord of the human, conscience, which is responsible only to his authority.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>God  has  authoritatively  addessed  the  human  conscience  only  in his  law,  the  only  perfect  revelation  of  which  in  this  world  is  the inspired Scriptures. Hence God himself has set the human conscience  free  from  all  obligation  to  believe  or  obey  any  such doctrines or commandments of men as are either contrary to or aside from the teachings of that Word.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commandments as a matter of conscience, is to be guilty of the sin of betraying the liberty of conscience and its loyalty to its only Lord; and to require such an obedience of others is to be guilty of the sin of usurping the prerogative  of  God  and  attempting  to  destroy  the  most  precious liberties of men.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This Christian liberty is not, however, absolute. It has its distinct end and limits. Its end, is that every person, without hindrance of his fellow-men, should have opportunity to serve God according to his will. The limits of this liberty are of two kinds: (a.) The authority of God, the Lord of conscience.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(b.) The equal liberties and rights of our fellow-men, with whom we dwell in organized societies.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since  God  has  established  both  the  Church  and  the  State, obedience to the legitimate authorities of either, acting within their rightful sphere, is an essential part of obedience to God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Church  has  the  right  from  God  of  exercising  its  discipline upon  any  who  maintain  or  practise  opinions  or  actions  plainly contrary to the light of nature, the doctrines of the Scripture, or the peace and welfare of the Christian community.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That, in the highest and only absolute sense, God alone is Lord of the  human  conscience,  has  never  been  denied.  The  real  question raised  by  Romanists,  and  those  in  general  who  have  claimed  the authority of binding and loosing the consciences of their fellow-men, relates to the standard which God has given us of his will, and the means he has chosen to enforce it. The Romanists maintain that the true  standard  and  organ  of  the  will  of  God  in  the  world  is  the infallible inspired Church, or body of bishops ordained regularly in a direct  line  from  the  apostles,  and  in  communion  with  the  See  of Rome. They hold that this Church has power to define doctrines and enact laws in God's name, binding the consciences of men; and that it possesses, in the power of the keys, the right, in execution of these laws,  to  absolve  or  condemn  in  God's  name,  to  bind  or  loose  the subject,  and  open  or  shut  the  kingdom  of  heaven,  and  to  impose ecclesiastical penalties. By far the larger part of what the Church of Rome actually enforces, in the way of faith and practice, is derived from ecclesiastical tradition and, evidently perverted interpretations of Scripture.</li>

<p>The  Erastian  State  Churches  of  Germany  and  England  have  often attempted to enforce outward uniformity in profession and worship, in  spite  of  the  conscientious  scruples  of  multitudes  of  their  best citizens, on the plea that the right and responsibility of regulating the ecclesiastical as well as the civil interests of the nation devolve upon the civil magistrate.</p>
<p>In opposition to all this, Protestants insist --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God has given only one, and that a perfect, rule of faith and practice in  spiritual  matters  in  the  inspired  Scriptures,  and  that  he has  hence  set  free  the  human  conscience  from  all  obligation  to believe or obey any such doctrines or commandments of men as are contrary to or aside from the teachings of that Word.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have already proved, under chapter i. sections 6,  7,  9,  10,  that Scripture  is  at  once  a  complete  and  perspicuous  rule  of  faith  and practice, and the supreme judge of all controversies. It hence follows self-evidently -- (1.) That nothing contrary to Scripture can be true; (2.)  That nothing in addition to what is revealed or commanded in Scripture can be binding upon the conscience; and (3.) That, since the Scriptures are perspicuous, every believer is personally responsible  for  interpreting  Scripture  and  judging  of  all  human doctrines  and  commandments  by  Scripture  for  himself.  This  is further proved --</p>
<ul>
<li>(a.)  Because  the  Scriptures  are  addressed  immediately  either  to  all men promiscuously, or else to the whole body of believers as such. Dent. vi. 4 -- 9; Luke i. 3; Rom. i. 7; 1 Cor. i. 2; Gal. i. 2, etc.</li>
<li>(b.)  All  Christians  promiscuously  are  commanded  to  search  the Scriptures (John v. 39; Acts xvii. 11; 2 Tim. iii. 15 -- 17), and to give a reason for their faith (1 Pet. iii. 15), and to resist the authority even of legitimate  church  rulers  when  it  is  opposed  to  that  of  the  Lord  of conscience. Acts iv. 19, 20.</li>
<li>(c.) The "Church" which Christ promises to guide into all truth and to preserve from fatal error is not a hierarchy or a body of officers, but the body of the " called " or " elect "-- the body of believers as such. 1 John ii. 20, 27; 1 Tim. iii. 15; Matt. xvi. 18; Eph. v. 27; 1 Pet. ii. 5; Col. i. 18, 24.</li>
<li>(d.)  Those  who  claim,  as  the  successors  of  the  apostles, to exercise this Authority, are utterly destitute of all the " signs of an apostle." 2 Cor. xii. 12; 1 Cor. ix. 1; Gal. i. 1, 12; Acts i. 21, 22. While provision was made for the regular perpetuation of the offices of deacon and presbyter  (1  Tim.  iii.  1  --  13),  there  was  no  direction  given  for  the perpetuation of the apostolate. They are utterly without credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question as to the right of the civil magistrate to impose religious articles  of  faith  or  rules  of  worship  will  recur  again  under  chapter xxiii., section 3. It hence follows --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  it  is  a  great  sin,  involving  at  the  same  time  sacrilege,  and treason to the human race, for any man or set of men to arrogate the prerogative of God and to attempt to bind the consciences of their fellow-men  by  any  obligation  not  certainly  imposed  by  God  and revealed in his Word. At the same time it is a sin of disloyalty to God, and a violation of our own nature as moral and rational beings, to yield to any such imposition, and to accept as a matter truly binding the  conscience  anything  not  authoritatively  taught  and  imposed  in the Scriptures.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It  is  of  the  highest  importance,  on  the  other  hand,  clearly  to understand that Christian liberty is not an absolute liberty to do as we  choose,  but  a  regulated  liberty  to  obey  God  without  hindrance from man. It is a freedom from usurped authority, in order that we may be the more perfectly subject to the only legitimate authority. It is hence absurd, as well as wicked, for a man to make his Christian liberty to obey only God a plea to disobey God, as he does whenever he violates any of the principles of natural right or of revealed truth which express at  once  the  unchangeable  nature  and  the  all-perfect will of God. There can be no liberty which sets a man independent of that will; and this is always the will of God concerning us, even our sanctification. 1 Thess. iv. 3.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Christian liberty is also further limited by the mutual duties we owe one another. The eating of meat offered to idols is in itself  a  thing indifferent, because not either commanded  or  forbidden. The</p>
<p>Christian, therefore, is at liberty either to eat or not to eat. But Paul commands  the  Corinthians  to  "take  heed  lest  by  any  means  this liberty of theirs become a stumblingblock to them that are weak." 1 Cor.  viii.  9.  To  allow  this  would  be  a  sin.  The  Christian,  therefore, may be at liberty to eat or not to eat, but he is not at all at liberty so to use his liberty that his fellow-man is injured thereby. The liberty ceases to be liberty, and becomes licentiousness, when it transcends the law of God or infringes upon the rights of our fellows.</p>
<ol>
<li>and 6. Since both the Church and the State are divine institutions, it follows necessarily that the authority of the officers of each, when acting  legitimately  within  their  respective  spheres,  represents  the authority of God and binds the Christian to obedience for conscience' sake. It follows also that both the civil magistrate and the ecclesiastical courts must have the right of enforcing obedience by a mode of discipline appropriate to  both  spheres  of  authority.  These matters, however, come up appropriately under chapters xxiii., xxv., and xxx.</li>

<p>SECTION I: The light  of  nature  showeth  that  there  is  a  God,  who hath lordship and sovereignty over all, is good, and doth good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the might.[1] But the acceptable way of worshiping the true God is instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may not be worshiped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scripture.[2]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Rom. 1:20; Psa. 19:1-4a; 50:6; 86:8-10; 89:5-7; 95:1-6; 97:6; 104:135; 145:9-12; Acts 14:17; Deut. 6:4-5 2. Deut. 4:15-20;  12:32;  Matt. 4:9-10; 15:9; Acts 17:23-25; Exod. 20:4-6, John 4:23-24; Col. 2:18-23</li>

<p>Section II. Religious worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and to him alone; [3] not to angels, saints, or any other creature:[4] and, since the fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the mediation of any other but of Christ alone.[5]</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THESE sections teach: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the obligation to render supreme worship and devoted service to God is a dictate of nature as well as a doctrine of revelation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God in his Word has prescribed for us how we may worship him acceptably; and that it is an offence to him and a sin in us either to  neglect  to  worship  and  serve  him  in  the  way  prescribed,  or  to attempt to serve him in any way not prescribed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the only proper objects of worship are the Father, Son, and holy Ghost; and that, since the fall, these are to be approached only through a Mediator, and through the mediation of none other than Christ alone.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  religious  worship  is  upon  no  pretence  to  be  rendered  to angels, or to saints, nor to any other creature.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it is a dictate of natural reason and conscience that a Being of infinite and absolute perfection, the Creator, Possessor and sovereign Lord, the Preserver and bountiful Benefactor of all creatures, and the absolute  moral  Governor  of  all  moral  agents,  should  be  adored, praised,  thanked,  supplicated,  obeyed,  and  served,  is  self-evident, and is witnessed to by the common consent of all nations of all ages. The reasons for this are -- (1.) His absolute perfection in himself. (2.) His  infinite  superiority  to  us.  (3.)  His  relation  to  us  as  Creator, Preserver, and moral Governor. (4.) Our absolute dependence upon him for every good, and our obligations for his infinite goodness to us. (5.) His commands requiring this at our hands. (6.) The impulse of our nature as religious beings and morally responsible agents. (7.) The fact that our faculties find their highest exercise, and our whole being its highest development and blessedness, in this worship and service.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have already seen, under chapter i., that God has given us in the Holy Scriptures an infallible, authoritative, complete, and perspicuous  rule  of  faith  and  practice.  That  "the  whole  counsel  of God,  concerning  all  things  necessary  for  his  own  glory  and  man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture." It hence necessarily follows that since God has prescribed the  mode  in  which  we  are  acceptably  to  worship  and  serve  him,  it must be an offence to him and a sin in us for us either to neglect his way, or in preference to practise our own. It may well have been that in  the  natural  state  of  man,  and  in  the  moral  relations  to  God  in which  he  stood  before  the  fall,  his  natural  reason,  conscience,  and religious  instincts  might  have  sufficed  to  direct  him  in  his  worship and.  service.  But  since  man's  moral  nature  is  depraved,  and  his religious instincts perverted, and his relations to God reversed by sin, it is self-evident that an explicit, positive revelation is necessary, not only to tell  man  that  God  will  admit  his  worship  at  all,  but  also  to prescribe 'the principles upon which, and the methods in which, that worship  and  service  may  be  rendered.  As  before  shown  from Scripture,  not  only  all  teaching  for  doctrine  the  commandments  of men, but all manner of will-worship, of self-chosen acts and forms of worship,  are  an  abomination  to  God.  At  the  same  time,  of  course, there  are,  as,  the  Confession  admits,  chapter  i.,  section  6,  "some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and the government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to  the  general  rules  of  the  Word."  These  relate  obviously  to  the application  of the principles  and  "general  rules"  laid down  in Scripture, for our guidance in worship and ecclesiastical government, to the varying times and circumstances of the case in hand. But we have  in  no  case  any  right,  upon  the  ground  of  taste,  fashion,  or expediency, to go beyond the clear warrant of Scripture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the divine worship is to be addressed equally to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, follows necessarily from what we have proved under chapter  ii.,  section  8  --  that  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  being</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>distinct persons, are yet each equally, in the same absolute sense, the one supreme God. That God can now be acceptably approached only through a Mediator is proved by what we have already proved,-- (1,) As  to  the  guilt  of  man  by  nature  and  in  consequence  of  habitual transgression;  (2.)  As  to  the  justice  of  God;  and  (3.)  As  to  the  fact that  God  has  from  eternity  determined  to  deal  with  men,  as  the subjects  of  redemption,  only  through  a  mediator.  If  Christ  as  our High Priest truly represents the elect before the Father, in obeying and suffering vicariously in their stead and in making intercession in their  behalf;  and  if  he  is  the  medium  through  which  all  gracious benefits come to us from God,-- it follows that all our approaches to God should be made through him. That God is the only proper object of  worship, and that Christ is the only Mediator through whom we may approach God, will be shown under the next head.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Religious worship is upon no pretence to be offered to angels, nor to  saints,  nor  to  any  other  creature,  nor  to  God  through  any  other mediator save Christ alone.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most authoritative Standards of the Church of Rome teach -- (1.) That  the  Virgin  Mary  and  saints  and  angels  are  to  receive  true religious worship, in proportion to their respective ranks. (2.) That they are to be invoked to help us in our times of need. (3) That they are  to  be  invoked  to  intercede  with  God  or  with  Christ  for  us.  (4.) Some of their most authoritative books of worship teach that God is to  be  asked to save and help us on the ground of the merits of the saints;  (5.)  That  the  pictures,  images,  and  relics  of  saints  and martyrs, are to be retained in churches and worshipped.</p>
<p>To avoid the charge of idolatry made upon them for these practices, they distinguish between (a.) Latria, or the highest religious worship, which is due to God alone, and (b.) Doulia, or that inferior religious worship  which  is  due  in  various  degrees  to  saints  and  angels, according to their rank. Sonic also mark a middle degree of worship, which is due to the Virgin Mary alone, by the term Hyperdoulia. They also  distinguish  between  (a.)  that  direct  worship  which  is  due severally to God, to the Virgin, or to the saints and angels, and (b.) that  indirect  worship  which  terminates  upon  the  picture  or  image which represents to the worshipper the direct object of his worship.</p>
<p>The objections to this entire system are -- (1.) That it has neither as a whole nor in any element of it a shadow of support in Scripture. (2.) That  the  reasons  for  worshipping  God  apply  to  the  worship  of  no other being. That reason and revelation unite in teaching us that a Being of infinite and absolute perfection, our Creator, Preserver, and moral Governor, stands apart from all other objects, and therefore is not to be classed as an object of worship with any other.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3.)  The  sin  of  worshipping  other  gods  and  angels  is  explicitly forbidden.  Ex.  xx.  3,  5;  Col.  ii.  18.  When  the  people  of  Lystra proposed to worship Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas, "they rent their clothes, and  ran  in among  the  people,"  saying, "We  also  are men,......and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God." Acts xiv. 14, 15.</li>
<li>(4.) The worship of images, or of God, Christ, or saints by images, is forbidden in the Second Commandment. Ex. xx. 4, 5.</li>
<li>(5.)  The  distinctions  they  make  between  the  different  degrees  of worship due to God and to holy creatures, and between the indirect worship which terminates upon the image or picture and the direct worship which terminates upon the person represented by it, are not their  peculiar  property,  but,  as  every  missionary  to  the  heathen knows,  are  common  to  them  with  the  educated  class  among  all idolaters. If the Romanists be not idolaters, the sins forbidden in the First and Second Commandments have never been committed.</li>
<li>(6.) The invocation of the saints is a pure absurdity, for unless they are omnipresent and omniscient, they cannot hear us; and in many cases, unless they are omnipotent, they cannot help us. The Romish explanation, that God may perhaps tell the saints what we pray, in</li>
</ul>
<p>order that the saints may in turn tell God, is worthy of the doctrine it explains.</p>
<p>(7.) The saints and angels are not mediators between us and God or us and Christ -- (a.) Because it is explicitly asserted that Christ is the only  Mediator  between  God  and  man.  1  Tim.  ii.  5.  (b}  Christ  has exhaustively discharged every requisite mediatorial function, both on earth and in heaven. Heb. ix. 12, 24; vii. 25; x. 14. (c.) Because we are "complete" in Christ;  and  we  are  exhorted  to  come  immediately  to God through Christ, and to come with the utmost boldness and sense of liberty. Col. ii. 10; Eph. ii. 18; iii. 12; Heb. iv. 15, 16; x. 19 -- 22. The very suggestion of supplementing the work of Jesus Christ with that of other mediators is infinitely derogatory to him. (d.) There can be no room for intercessors between us and Christ, because Christ is our tender Brother Matt. xi. 28), and because it is the once of the Holy Ghost to draw men to Christ. John vi. 44; xvi.18, 14. (e.) Even if there were  need  for  other  mediators,  the  saints  would  not  be  fit  for  the place.  They  are  absent;  they  cannot  bear  when  we  cry.  They  are dependent; they cannot help others. As we have seen, they have no supererogatory  merits,  and  therefore  cannot  lay  in  our  behalf  a foundation for our acceptance with God. They are busy worshipping and  enjoying  Christ  in  person,  and  have  neither  the  time,  the opportunity, nor the ability to manage the affairs of the world.</p>
<p>SECTION III:  Prayer,  with  thanksgiving,  being  one  special  part  of religious  worship,[6]  is  by  God  required  of  all  men:[7]  and,  that  it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son,[8] by the help of  his  Spirit,[9]  according  to  his  will,[10]  with  understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance;[11] and, if vocal, in a known tongue.[12]</p>

</ol>
<p>Section  IV.  Prayer  is  to  be  made  for  things  lawful;[13]  and  for  all sorts  of  men  living,  or  that  shall  live  hereafter:[14]  but  not  for  the dead,[15]  nor  for  those  of  whom  it  may  be  known  that  they  have sinned the sin unto death.[16]</p>

</ol>
<p>Our Confession having established the general truth as to the object to whom religious worship is to be rendered, and as to the source of our  knowledge  of  its  nature  and  proper  methods,  now  proceeds  to state more particularly what the Scriptures teach on this subject.</p>
<p>These sections teach --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  prayer  is  a  principal  part  of  religious  worship.  The  word "prayer"  is  used  constantly  in  a  more  general  and  a  more  specific sense. In its more specific sense it is equivalent to supplication, the act of the soul engaged in presenting its desires to God, and asking God  to  gratify them  and  to  supply  all the necessities of the supplicant. In its general sense, prayer is used to express every act of the soul engaged in spiritual intercourse with God. In this sense the main elements it embraces are -- (1.) Adoration, (2.) Confession, (3.) Supplication, (4.) Intercession, (5,) Thanksgiving. Thus prayer in its wide sense includes all direct acts of worship. And hymns and psalms of  praise  are  in  their  essence  only  metrical  and  musically-uttered prayers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Confession here asserts that prayer is required of all men. This is absolutely true, even of the heathen who know not God, and of the unregenerate who are morally unable to pray in a manner pleasing to God; because neither our knowledge of moral truths nor our moral ability  to  do  what  is  right  is  the  measure  of  our  responsibility.  The duty of prayer is a natural duty growing out of our natural relations to  God,  manifested  by  the  natural  conscience,  and  enjoined  in  the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scriptures upon all men indiscriminately. 1 Thess. v. 17; Acts viii. 22, 23; Luke xi. 9 -- 13. We are told not only to pray after we receive the Holy Spirit, but to pray also that we may receive him.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order that prayer may be acceptable to God and effectual, it is here  taught  that  it  is  necessary  --  (1.)  That  it  should  be  offered through  the  mediation.  of  Christ.  It  has  been  shown  above,  under sections  1  and  2,  that  all  religious  worship  must  be  presented through  Christ;  that  is,  relying  upon  his  merits,  and  approaching God through his  present  personal  intercession.  Prayer  is  a  kind  of religious worship. What, therefore, is true of the class is true of all its elements. Besides, this truth follows from all that is revealed of our redemption  through  the  merits  of  Christ,  and  is  directly  taught  in Scripture. John xiv. 13, 14; xvi. 23, 24. (2.) It must be made by the help of the Holy Ghost. The same word paraclete is applied to Christ and  to  the  Holy  Ghost:  it  is  translated  when  applied  to  Christ advocate  (1  John  ii.  1),  and  comforter  when  applied  to  the  Holy Ghost. John xiv. 16. Thus Christ as our Advocate makes intercession for  us  in  heaven  (Rom.  viii.  34);  the  Holy  Ghost  as  our  Advocate makes  intercession  within  us,  inditing  our  prayers,  kindling  our desires  for  that  which  is  according  to  the  will  of  God,  and  thus maintaining harmony in the constant current of petition ascending from Christ the Head in heaven and his members on earth. Rom. viii. 26, 27. (3.) It is essential to acceptable prayer that the heart of the worshipper  should.  be  in  the  proper  state,  and  that  his  prayer  be offered  in  reverence  for  the  majesty  and  moral  perfections  of  God; humility, because of our guilt and pollution; submission to his will; confidence  in  his  ability  and  willingness  to  help  us,  and  upon  his covenanted  grace;  intelligent apprehension  of  the  relations we sustain, the nature of the service we are engaged in, and the subjectmatter of our prayer and objects of petition; and real earnestness and fervency of heart, corresponding fully to all the words whereby our prayer  is  expressed;  and  with  importunity  and  perseverance.  Luke xviii.  1  --  8.  And  when the prayer is common between two or more persons,  it  is  self-evident  that  it  must  be  expressed  in  a  language common to all; otherwise, it must cease to be in any sense the prayer of those who fail to understand it. This point is aimed at the Romish custom of uttering many of her public prayers in Latin, which to the vast  majority  of  her  worshippers  is  an  unknown  tongue.  This  is explicitly forbidden. 1 Cor. xiv. 1 -- 33.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to the objects of petition, we are here taught that they cover the whole ground of things that are at once desirable and lawful. This is self-evident, because  we  depend  upon  God  for  all  things,  and therefore  should  ask  him  for  everything  we  need;  yet,  of  course, giving a precedence in our desires for the " best things,' " seeking first the kingdom of heaven and God's righteousness." 1 Cor. xii, 31; Matt. vi. 33. Desires for unlawful things are of course unlawful desires, and should be laid aside and repented of. Even concerning those things which it is in general lawful for us to desire, there may be in many instances  uncertainty  whether  it  is  the  will  of  God  that  we  should have them at the time and in the way we desire. In every such case we should, of course, make our petitions conditional upon God's will, as our blessed Lord did in Gethsemane. Luke xxii. 42; 1 John v. 14.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As to the subjects of intercession, we are taught to pray for all men living or to live. 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2; John xvii. 20. But not for those already dead, nor for those known to have committed the unpardonable sin.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Romish Church concerning prayers for the dead is a dependent part of their doctrine concerning the state of the souls of men after death. They hold that those who are perfect at the time of death go immediately to heaven; those who are infidels or die in mortal sin  go  immediately  to  hell;  but  the  great  mass  of  imperfect Christians go to purgatory, where they must stay until they get fit for heaven.  Concerning  purgatory,  the  Council  of  Trent  teaches  --  (1.) That there is a purifying fire through which imperfect Christian souls must pass. (2.) That the souls temporarily suffering therein may be materially benefited by the prayers of their fellow-Christians and the masses offered up in their behalf on earth. (Council of Trent, sess. 25.)</p>
<p>But if there is no purgatory, as will be shown under chapter xxxii., there can be no prayers for the dead, since those in heaven need no intercession, and for those in hell none can avail. It is as presumptuous  as  it  is  futile  to  assail  the  throne  of  God  with supplications  "when  once  the  Master  of  the  house  has  shut  to  the door."  Luke  xiii.  25.  The  Scriptures  teach  of  only  two  states  of existence beyond  death,  and  of  a  great,  impassable  gulf  fixed between.  Luke  xvi.  25,  26.  Besides,  the  practice  of  praying  for  the dead has no warrant, direct or by remote implication, in Scripture. SECTION V: The reading of the Scriptures with godly fear,[17] the sound  preaching  [18]  and  conscionable  hearing  of  the  Word,  in obedience  unto  God,  with  understanding,  faith,  and  reverence,[19] singing  of  psalms  with  grace  in  the  heart;[20]  as  also,  the  due administration and worthy receiving of the sacraments instituted by Christ,  are  all  parts  of  the  ordinary  religious  worship  of  God:[21] beside religious oaths,[22] vows,[23] solemn fastings,[24] and thanksgivings upon special occasions,[25] which are, in their several times and seasons, to be used in an holy and religious manner.[26]</p>

<p>SECTION VI: Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worship, is now, under the gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed: [27] but God is to be worshiped everywhere,[28] in spirit and truth; [29] as, in private families [30] daily,[31] and in secret, each one by himself;[32] so, more solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or willfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God, by his Word or providence, calleth thereunto.[33]</p>

</ol>
<p>These sections proceed to particularize the different ways in which God  requires  us  under  the  present  dispensation  to  worship  him. These are the regular and the occasional acts of worship. The regular worship  of  God  is  to  be  conducted  in  the  public  assembly,  in  the private family, and personally in secret. The worship of God in the public assembly is to consist in the reading, preaching, and hearing of the Word; prayer, singing of psalms; and the administration and receiving of the sacraments instituted by him. In the Word, read or properly preached, God speaks to us, and we worship him by hearing with reverence, diligent attention, and self-application and obedience. In prayer and the singing of praise we address to God the holy affections, desires, and thanksgivings inspired in our hearts by his Holy Spirit.  In  the  sacraments  God  communes  with  and  enters into covenant with our souls, and we commune with and enter into covenant with him. And the acceptability of this worship depends not at all, as Ritualists fondly imagine, upon the sanctity of the place in which  it  is  rendered  or  the  direction  in  which  it  is  addressed.  The dispensation in which worship was limited to holy places, persons, and seasons, has been done away with by our Lord, as we have seen under chapters vii. and xix., and as Christ plainly teaches the woman of Samaria. John iv. 20 -- 24. But its acceptance depends upon -- (1.) Its being accompanied with .and founded upon the pure, unadulterated truth of God's Word; (2.) Its being the fruit of the Holy Ghost, the result of en- lightened, reverent, and fervent love; (3.) Its being offered entirely through the mediation of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>"Besides the public worship in congregations, it is the indispensable duty of each person, alone in secret, and of every family by itself in private, to pray to and worship God.</p>
<p>"Secret  worship  is  most  plainly  enjoined  by  our  Lord.  Matt.  vi.  6; Eph, vi. 18. In this duty every one, apart by himself, is to spend some time in prayer, reading the Scriptures, holy meditation, and serious self-examination. The many advantages arising from a conscientious discharge of these duties are best known to those who are found in the faithful discharge of them.</p>
<p>"Family  worship,  which  ought  to  be  performed  by  every  family, ordinarily  morning  and  evening,  consists  in  prayer,  reading  the Scriptures, and singing praises.</p>
<p>"  The head of the family, who is to lead in this service, ought to be careful that all the members of his household duly attend; and that none  withdraw  themselves  unnecessarily  from  any  part  of  family worship; and that all refrain from their common business while the Scriptures  are  read,  and  gravely  attend  to  the  same,  no  less  than when prayer and praise are offered up.</p>
<p>"Let  the  heads  of  families  be  careful  to  instruct  their  children  and servants in the principles of religion. Every proper opportunity ought to be embraced for such instruction. But we are of opinion that the Sabbath evenings, after public worship, shouldst be sacredly preserved for this purpose. Therefore we highly disapprove of paying unnecessary private visits on the Lord's day; admitting strangers into the  families,  except  when  necessity  or  charity  requires  it;  or  any other practices, whatever plausible pretences may be offered in their favour,  if  they  interfere  with  the  above  important  and  necessary duty." [American] Directory for Worship, chap. xv.</p>
<p>The  occasional  modes  by  which  God  may  be  in  proper  seasons worshipped are such as religious oaths, and vows, and fasting, and special thanksgiving. Of oaths and vows we will treat under chapter xxii. Of the propriety and usefulness of special seasons of fasting and of thanksgiving, the examples of God's Word (Ps. cvii.; Matt. ix. 15) and the experience of the Christian Church in modern times leave no room for doubt.</p>
<p>SECTION:  VII.  As  it  is  the  law  of  nature,  that,  in  general,  a  due proportion  of  time  be  set  apart  for  the  worship  of  God;  so,  in  his Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven, for a Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him:[34] which, from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week, [35] and, from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week, which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's day,[36] and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.

<p>SECTION: VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men,  after  a  due  preparing  of  their  hearts,  and  ordering  of  their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly employments and recreations,[38] but also are taken up, the whole time, in the public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.[39]</p>

</ol>
<p>Under  chapter  xix.  we  saw  that  the  different  laws  of  God,  when classified according to their respective grounds or reasons, might be grouped  as  follows:  (1.)  Those  having  their  ground  in  the  divine nature,  and  therefore  universal  and  immutable.  (2.)  Those  having their ground, as far as known to us, simply and purely in the divine will,  hence called positive commandments, and binding only so far and  so  long  as  commanded.  (3.)  Those  having  their  ground  and reason in the temporary circumstances to which they were adapted, and to which alone they were intended to apply, so that they cease to be binding as soon as those circumstances cease to exist. (4.) Those which have their ground in the universal and permanent state and relations  of  men  in  this  world,  and  hence  are  intended  to  be  as universal and as permanent as those relations.</p>
<p>It  is  evident  that  the  Scriptural  law  as  to  the  Sabbath  comes partly under the fourth and partly also under the second of these classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The law of the Sabbath in part has its ground in the universal and permanent needs of human nature, and especially of men embraced under  an  economy  of  redemption.  It  is  designed  --  (1.)  To  keep  in remembrance  the  fact  that  God  created  the  world  and  all  its inhabitants (Gen ii. 2, 3; Ex. xx. 11), which is the great fundamental fact  in  all  religion,  whether  natural  or  revealed.  (2.)  As  changed  to the first day of the week it is designed to keep in remembrance the fact of the ascension of the crucified Redeemer and his session at the right hand of power, the great central fact in the religion of Christ. (3.) To be a perpetual type of the eternal Sabbath of the saints which remains. Heb. iv. 3 -- 11. (4.) To afford a suitable time for the public and  private  worship  of  God  and  the  religious  instruction  of  the people. (5.) To afford a suitable period of rest from the wear and tear of  labour, which is rendered alike physically and morally necessary from  the  present  constitution of human  nature  and  from  the condition of man in this world.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All  of  these  reasons  for  the  institution  of  the  Sabbath  have  their ground in human nature, and remain in full force among all men of all  nations,  in  all  stages  of  intellectual  and  moral  development. Hence  the  Sabbath  was  introduced  as  a  divine  institution  at  the creation of the race, and was then enjoined upon man as man, and hence upon the race generally and in perpetuity. Gen. ii. 2, 3. Hence we find that the Jews (Gen. vii. 10; viii. 10; xxix. 27, 28; Job ii. 13), and all Gentile nations also, as the Egyptians, Arabians, Indians, etc., divided  their  time  by  weeks,  or  periods  of  seven  days,  from  the earliest  ages.  Hence  before  the  giving  of  the  law  the  Jews  were required to observe the Sabbath. Ex. xvi. 23. Hence also the law with respect to the Sabbath has been incorporated into the Decalogue, as one of the ten requirements in which the entire moral law, touching all  our  relations  to  God  and  to  our  fellow-men,  is  generalized  and condensed. It was written by the finger of God on stone. It is put side by  side  with  the  commandments  which  require  us  to  love  God,  to honour his name, and which forbid unchastity and murder. It was put, as a part of the "testimonies of God," under the "mercy-seat," at the foundation of his throne. And hence, when the great commandment  is  uttered,  God  does  not  say,  "I  appoint  to  you  a Sabbath-day," but, "remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy," -evidently  implying  that  he  was  referring  to  a  well-known  and  preexistent institution common to the Jews with the Gentiles. And the reason annexed for the enactment of the law is not a fact peculiar to Jewish history, but a fact underlying all the relations God sustains to the  entire  race,  and,  as  before  shown,  the  fact  out  of  which  the Sabbatic institution had originated thousands of years before --" For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea," etc. Ex. xx. 8 -ll.  So  Christ  says,  "The  Sabbath  was  made  for  man;"  that  is,  for mankind. Mark ii. 27.</p>
<ol>
<li>The law of the Sabbath, in fact, is also a positive commandment, having its ground in the will of God as supreme Lord. That a certain portion of time should be set apart for the worship of God and the religious  instruction  of  men  is  a  plain  dictate  of  reason.  That  a certain portion of time should be set apart for rest from labour is by experience found to be, on physiological and moral grounds, highly desirable. That some monument of the creation of the world and of the resurrection of Christ, and that some permanent and frequentlyrecurring type of the rest of heaven,  should  be instituted, is eminently  desirable  for  man,  considered  as  a  religious  being.  But that all these ends should be combined  and  secured  by  one institution,  and  that  precisely  one  whole  day  in  seven  should  be allotted to that purpose, and that this one day in seven should be at one  time  the  seventh  and  afterward  the  first  day  of  the  week,  is evidently a matter of positive enactment, and binds us as long as the indications of the divine will in the matter remain unchanged.</li>
</ol>
<p>The time of observance was changed from the seventh to the first day of  the  week  in  the  age  of  the  apostles,  and  consequently with their sanction; and that day, as "the Lord's day" (Rev. i. 10), has ever since been observed in the stead of the ancient Sabbath, in all portions and ages of the Christian Church. We accept this change as it comes to us, and believe it to be according to the will of God -- (1.) Because of its apostolic origin; (2.) Because of the transcendent importance of the resurrection of Christ, which is thus associated with the creation of the  world  by  God,  as  the  foundation  of  the  Christian  religion;  and (3.) Because of the universal consent of Christians of all generations and  denominations,  and  the  approbation  of  the  Holy  Ghost  that dwelleth in them that is implied thereby.</p>
<p>As to the observance of the Christian Sabbath, the obvious general rule is, that it is to be observed, (1.) Not in the spirit of the law, which Christ condemns Matt. xii. 1; Luke xiii. 15), but in the holy and free spirit of the gospel, (2.) In accordance with the ends for which it is instituted, and which have been above enumerated.</p>
<p>Since  God  has  appointed  the  Sabbath  to  be  one  day  in  seven,  we should consecrate the whole day, without curtailment or alienation, to  the  purposes  designed;  that  is,  to  rest  from  worldly  labour,  the worship of God, and the religious instruction of our fellow-men. We should be diligent in using the whole day for these purposes, and to avoid, and, as far as lieth in us, lead our fellow-men to avoid, all that hinders the most profitable application of the day to its proper ends. And nothing is to be allowed to interfere with this consecration of the day except the evident and reasonable demands of necessity as far as our  own  interests  are  concerned,  and  of  mercy  as  far  as  the necessities of our fellow-men and of dependent animals are concerned.</p>

<p>SECTION I. A lawful oath is a part of religious worship,[1] wherein, upon  just  occasion,  the  person  swearing  solemnly  calleth  God  to witness what he asserteth, or promiseth, and to judge him according to the truth or falsehood of what he sweareth.[2]</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Chr. 6:22-23</p>
<p>SECTION II. The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence.[3] Therefore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name;  or,  to  swear  at  all  by  any  other  thing,  is  sinful,  and  to  be abhorred.[4]  Yet,  as  in  matters  of  weight  and  moment,  an  oath  is warranted by the Word of God, under the new testament as well as under the old;[5] so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.[6]</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION III. Whosoever taketh an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is the truth:[7] neither may any man bind himself by oath to anything but what is good and just, and what he believeth so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.[8] Yet it is a sin to refuse an oath touching any thing that is good and just, being imposed by lawful authority.</p>

<p>SECTION IV. An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of  the  words,  without  equivocation,  or  mental  reservation.[9]  It cannot oblige to sin; but in anything not sinful, being taken, it binds to  performance,  although  to  a  man's  own  hurt.[10]  Nor  is  it  to  be violated, although made to heretics, or infidels.[11]</p>

<li>Ezek. 17:16-19; Josh. 9:18-19; II Sam. 21:1</li>
</ol>
<p>The  subjects  treated  of  in  these  sections  are  --  1.  The  nature  of  a lawful oath. 2. The only name in which it is lawful to swear. 3. The propriety  and  duty  of  taking  oaths  upon  proper  occasions.  4.  The sense in which an oath is to be interpreted. And, 5. The extent and grounds of its binding obligation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A  lawful oath consists in calling upon God, the occasion being of sufficient  seriousness  and  importance, to witness the truth of what we affirm as true, or our voluntary assumption of an obligation to do something  in  the  future  --  with  an  implied  imprecation  of  God's disfavour if we lie or prove unfaithful to our engagements. This last is generally expressed by the phrase forming the concluding part of the formula of most oaths, "So help me God; "-- i.e., Let God so help me as I have told the truth, or as I will keep my promise.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence  an  oath  is  an  act  of  supreme  religious  worship,  since  it recognizes  the  omnipresence,  omniscience,  absolute  justice  and sovereignty  of  the  Person  whose  august  witness  is  invoked,  and whose judgment is appealed to as final.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It hence follows that it is a sin equivalent to that of worshipping a false god if we swear by any other than the only true and living God; and a sin of idolatry if we swear by any thing or place, although it be associated  with  the  true  God.  Those  who  swear  with  uplifted  hand</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>swear  by  the  God  who  created,  preserves,  and  governs  all  things. Those who swear with hand upon or kissing the Bible, swear by the God who reveals himself in the Bible -- that is, by the true Christian God.  It  is  evident  that  none  who  believe  in  the  true  God  can, consistently with their integrity, swear by a false god. And it is no less evident that it is dishonest for an atheist to go through the form of swearing  at  all;  or  for  an  infidel  to  swear  with  his  hand  upon  the Christian  Scriptures,  thereby  professing  to  invoke  a  God  in  whose existence he does not believe.</p>
<p>This principle is fully recognized in Scripture. We are told to swear by the true God: "Unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear," Isa. xlv. 23; "He that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth," Isa. 1xv. 16; "Thou shalt fear JEHOVAH thy God and serve  him,  and  shalt  swear  by  his  name,"  Deut.  vi.  13.  We  are forbidden to swear by the name of false gods: " How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods." Jer. v. 7; Josh. xxiii. 7.</p>
<ol>
<li>The  literal  meaning  of  the  Third  Commandment  is,  "Thou  shalt not  take  the  name  of  thy  God  in  that  which  is  false"  --  that  is,  to confirm an untruth. The command not to take a false oath, or any oath  upon  a  trifling  occasion,  by  implication  carries  with  it  the permission to call upon the God of truth to confirm the truth upon all worthy occasions. Hence the oath is enjoined in the Old Testament as  a  recognized  religious  institution.  Deut.  vi.  13;  x.  20,  etc.  Christ himself, when put upon oath in the form common among the Jews, did not hesitate to answer. Matt. xxvi. 63, 64. Paul often appeals to God for the truth of his statements -- thus: " God is my witness;" "I call God for a record upon my soul." Rom. i. 9; 2 Cor. i. 23. In Heb. vi. 13 -- 18, Paul declares that God, in order "to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath;" and  that,  "because  he  could  swear  by  no  greater,  he  sware  by himself."</li>
</ol>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that the words of our Saviour (Matt. v. 33 -37), " Swear not at all," cannot be intended to forbid swearing upon proper occasions in the name of the true God, but must be designed to forbid the calling upon his name in ordinary conversation and on trifling occasions, and the swearing by that which is not God.</p>
<p>The proper occasions upon which an oath may be taken are all those in  which  serious  and  perfectly  lawful  interests  are  involved, and in which  an  appeal  to  the  witness  of  God  is  necessary  to  secure confidence and end strife (Heb. vi. 16); and also whenever the oath is imposed  by  competent  authority  upon  those  subject  to  it.  In  the latter case, our Confession says that the taking the oath is a duty, and its refusal a sin.</p>
<p>The  oath,  of  course,  both  because  of  its  nature  as  an  act  of  divine worship  and  because  of  the  effect  designed  to  be  attained  by  it  -namely, the establishment of confidence among men -- ought always to  be  administered  and  taken  in  a  reverent  manner,  and  with whatever outward action -- such as raising the hand, placing it upon the Scriptures or kissing them -- as by common consent is generally understood,  by  all  parties  and  witnesses,  to  signify  that  the  God appealed  to  is  the  true  God  of  creation,  of  providence,  and  of  the Christian revelation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The oath is always to be interpreted and kept sacred by the person taking  it,  in  the  sense  in  which  he  honestly  believes  that  it  is understood  by  the  person  who  imposes  it.  It  is  evident  that  if  the government,  the  judge,  the  magistrate,  or  a  private  fellow-citizen, require an oath from us for their satisfaction, and if we put a private sense  upon  the  matter  upon  which  we  invoke  the  witness  of  God different  from  that  which  we  know  they  understand  by  it,  that  we deceive them intentionally; and, by calling God to witness our truth while we are engaged in the very act of a lie, we commit the sin of perjury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  obligation  of  the  oath  arises  (1.)  out  of  the  original  and universal  obligation  to  speak  the  truth  and  to  keep  faith  in  all engagements; (2.) and, in addition to this, our obligation to honour God,  and  to  avoid  dishonouring  him  by  invoking  his  witness  to  a falsehood;  (3.)  the  profanity  involved  in  suspending  our  hopes  of God's favour upon the truth of that which we know and intend to be false.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An oath cannot bind to that which is in itself unlawful, because the obligation  of  the  law  is  imposed  upon  us  by  the  will  of  God,  and therefore takes precedence of all obligations imposed upon us by the will of men or by ourselves; and the lesser obligation cannot relieve from  the  greater.  The  sin  is  in  taking  the  oath  to  do  the  unlawful thing, not in breaking it. Therefore Luther was right in breaking his monastic vows. Neither can an oath to do that which is impossible bind, for its impossibility is an expression of the will of God.</p>
<p>But  an  oath  to  do  what  is  in  itself  right  and  binding  imposes  an additional obligation to perform it -- the obligation imposed by  the law,  and  the  obligation  voluntarily  assumed  by  ourselves.  And  an oath to do anything which is lawful binds both for truth's sake and for God's sake. And --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) This obligation evidently does not depend upon the goodness or badness of the persons imposing the oath. An oath to an infidel or a heretic binds as much as an oath to a saint. The Romanists excuse the practice of their Church of releasing persona from the obligation of oaths to infidels or heretics, and of breaking faith generally with all with whom she has controversy, on the plea that an oath cannot bind to that which is unlawful or release from a prior obligation, and that the highest of all obligations is to subserve at all cost the interest of the Church. But they deliberately make the oath in order to break it,  and  there-  fore  both  lie  and  profane  God's  holy  name  in  the making and the breaking. Besides, the interest of the Church is not the superior law which takes precedence of all oaths, but the clearly revealed will of God only.</li>
<li>(2.) The obligation of the oath binds even when a man swears to his own disadvantage. Ps. xv. 4.</li>
<li>(3.) Nor is the obligation impaired when the oath is extorted either by violence or fraud. Thus the oaths imposed by conquerors upon the vanquished bind, because they are voluntarily assumed in preference to the alternatives presented. And thus Joshua kept the oath which the  Gibeonites  had  induced  him  through  deceit  to  swear  in  their behalf. Joshua ix. 8 -- 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION V. A vow is of the like nature with a promissory oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness.[12]</p>
<ol>
<li>Num. 30:2; Isa. 19:21; Eccl. 5:4-6; Psa. 61:8; 66:13-14</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION VI. It is not to be made to any creature, but to God alone: [13] and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of faith,  and  conscience  of  duty,  in  way  of  thankfulness  for  mercy received,  or  for  the  obtaining  of  what  we  want,  whereby  we  more strictly bind ourselves to necessary duties; or, to other things, so far and so long as they may fitly conduce thereunto.[14]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Deut. 23:21-23; Gen. 28:20-22; I Sam. 1:11; Psa. 66:13-14; 132:2-</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psa. 50:14; 76:11; 116:14 5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION  VII.  No  man  may  vow  to  do  anything  forbidden  in  the Word of God, or what would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in his own power, and for the performance whereof he hath no promise of ability from God.[15] In which respects, popish monastical  vows  of  perpetual  single  life,  professed  poverty,  and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle himself.[16]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Acts 23:12-14; Mark 6:26; Num. 30:5, 8, 12-13</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matt. 10:11-12; I Cor. 7:2, 9; Heb. 13:4; Eph. 4:28; I Thess. 4:11-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>12; I Cor. 7:23</p>
<p>The vow is a promise made to God. In the oath, the parties are both men, and God is invoked as a witness. In the vow, God is the party to whom the promise is made. It is of like nature with an oath, because we are bound to observe them on the same grounds -- because of our obligation to truth, and because of our obligation to reverence God. Lightly to vow on a trifling occasion, or having vowed to fail to keep it, is an act of profanity to God.</p>
<p>As in the case of the oath, we have abundant Scriptural sanction for the vow. Eccles. v. 4; Ps. 1xxvi. 11; 1 Sam. i. 11; and the case of Paul, Acts xviii. 18. Reception of either of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper involves very sacred and binding vows to God; and the  same  is  repeated  whenever  in  prayer,  orally  or  in  writing,  we formally or informally renew our covenant promises to God. Thus a vow, as any other promise, may bind generally to loyal obedience or specially to some particular action.</p>
<p>A  vow  cannot  bind  to  do  that  which  is  unlawful  or  impossible,  for reasons before explained in relation to an oath; nor when made by a child  or  other  person  under  authority  and  destitute  of  the  right  to bind  themselves  of  their  own  will.  Num.  xxx.  1  --  8.  Nor  can  it continue to bind in cases in which its continued observance is found clearly  to  be  inconsistent  with  our  spiritual  interests;  for  then  it  is certain that God does not wish it, and a promise can never bind when the party to whom it is made does not desire it kept.</p>
<p>When the matter of the vow is not unlawful, but morally indifferent, the vow  is binding;  but  experience  abundantly  proves  that  to accumulate such obligations is very injurious. The Word of God in the Scriptures imposes upon us by his authority all that it is his will or  for  our  interest  for  us  to  observe.  The  multiplication  of  selfimposed  duties dishonours him, and greatly harasses us and endangers our safety. Vows had better be restricted to the voluntary assumption and promise to observe, with the help of divine  grace, duties imposed by God and plainly revealed in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>THESE sections teach as follows: --</p>
<ol>
<li>Civil  government  is  a  divine  institution,  and  hence  the  duty  of obedience to our legitimate rulers is a duty owed to God as well as to our  fellow-men.  Some  have  supposed  that  the  right  or  legitimate authority of human government has its foundation ultimately in "the consent  of  the  governed,"  "the  will  of  the  majority,"  or  in  some imaginary "social compact" entered into by the forefathers of the race at the origin of social life. It is self-evident, however, that the divine will is the source of all government; and the obligation to obey that will, resting  upon  all  moral  agents,  the  ultimate  ground  of  all obligation to obey human governments. This is certain -- (1.) Because God is the Creator and absolute Possessor of all men. (2.) Because he has formed their constitution as intelligent, morally responsible, free agents,  and  is  the  Lord  of  the  conscience.  (3.)  Because  he  is  the supreme moral Governor of a11 moral agents, and because his allembracing  moral  law  of  absolute  perfection  requires  all  that  is morally  right  of  every  kind,  and  forbids  all  that  is  morally  wrong. Hence every moral obligation of every kind is a duty owed to God. (4.) Because God has constituted man a social being in his creation, and has providentially organized him in families and communities, and thus made civil government an absolute necessity. (5.) Because as the providential Ruler of the world God uses civil government as his  instrument  in  promoting  the  great  ends  of  redemption  in  the upbuilding  of  his  kingdom  in  the  world.  (6.)  This  is  explicitly affirmed in Scripture: "There is no power but of God; the powers that be  are  ordained  of  God.  Whosoever,  therefore,  resisteth  the  power resisteth  the  ordinance  of  God."  Rom.  xiii.  1,  2.  To  the  good  the magistrate is "the minister of God for good; " and to the evil he is a " minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.' Rom. xiii. 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course God has not prescribed for all men any particular form or order  of  succession  of  civil  government.  He  has  laid  the  general foundation  both  for  the  duty  and  necessity  of  government  in  the consciences  and  in  the  social  natures  of  all men,  and  in  the circumstances of all communities, while he has left every people free to choose their own form of government in their own way, according to  their  various  degrees  of  civilization,  their  social  and  political condition, their historical antecedents, and as they are instructed by his Word, and led and sustained by his providence.</p>
<p>In this sense God as Creator, as revealed in the light of nature, has established  civil  government  among  men  from  the  beginning,  and among all peoples and nations, of all ages and generations. But in the development of the plan of redemption the God-man as mediatorial King has assumed the government of the universe. Matt. xxviii. 18; Phil.  ii.  9  --  11;  Eph.  i.  17  --  23.  As  the  universe  constitutes  one physical  and  moral  system,  it  was  necessary  that  his  headship  as Mediator  should  extend  to  the  whole  and  to  every  department thereof, in order that all things should work together for good to his people and for his glory, that all his enemies should be subdued and finally  judged  and  punished,  and  that  all  creatures  should  worship him, as his Father had determined. Rom. viii. 28; 1 Cor. xv. 25; Heb. x. 13; i. 6; Rev. v. 9 -- 13. Hence the present providential Governor of the  physical  universe  and  "Ruler  among  the  nations"  is  Jesus  of Nazareth,  the  King  of  the  Jews,  to  whose  will  all  laws  should  be conformed,  and  whom  all  nations  and  all  rulers  of  men  should acknowledge and serve. "He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OP KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. Rev. xix. 16.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The proximate end for which God has ordained magistrates is the promotion of the public good, and the ultimate end is the promotion of  his  own  glory.  This  evidently  follows  from  the  revealed  fact  that the glory or manifested excellence of the Creator is the chief end he had in the general system of things, and hence the appointed chief end of each intelligent agent. Rom. ix. 22, 23; xi. 36; Col. i. 16; Eph. i. 5, 6; 1 Pet. iv. 11. If the glory of God is the chief end of every man, it must be the chief end equally of all nations and communities of men; and it ought to be made the governing purpose of every individual in all his relations and actions, public and official, as well as private and personal. And if the glory of God is his chief end, it is that to which all other objects and designs are subordinated as ends. The specific way in which the civil magistrate is to endeavour to advance the glory of God is through the promotion of the good of the community (Rom. xiii. 4)  in  temporal  concerns,  including  education,  morals,  physical prosperity, the protection of life and property, and the preservation of order. And --</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christian magistrates should also seek in their influential positions to promote piety as well as order. 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2. This they are to do, not by assuming the functions of the Church, nor by attempting by endowments  officially  to patronize or control the Church,  but personally by their example,  and  officially by giving impartial protection  and  all  due  facility  for  the  Church  in  its  work;  by  the explicit recognition of God and of Jesus Christ "as Ruler among the nations;" and by the enactment  and enforcement of all laws conceived  in  the  true  spirit  of  the  Gospel,  touching  all  questions upon which the Scriptures indicate the will of God specifically or in general principle, and  especially as touching questions of the Sabbath-day, the  oath,  marriage  and  divorce,  capital  punishments, etc., etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It  is  lawful  for  Christians  to  accept  and  execute  the  once  of  a magistrate. This is evident enough. Indeed, in the highest sense, it is lawful for none other than Christians to be magistrates or any thing else,  since  it  is  a  violation  of  God's  will  that  any  man  is  not  a Christian.  And  the  greater  the  number  and  the  importance  of  the relations a man assumes, the greater becomes his obligation to be a Christian, in order that he may be qualified to discharge them all for the glory of God and the good of all concerned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christian  magistrates  may  lawfully,  under  the  New  Testament, wage war upon just and necessary occasions. The right and duty of self-defense is established by the inalienable instincts of nature, by reason,  conscience,  the  Word  of  God,  and  the  universal  consent  of mankind. If it is right for an individual to take life in self-defense, it must  be  equally  right  for  a  community  to  do  so  on  the  same principle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is very difficult to decide in particular cases when it is right for a Christian nation to go to war, and it is not our place to consider such questions.  But  the  following  general  principles  are  very  plain  and very  certain:  --  War  is  an  incalculable  evil,  because  of  the  lives  it destroys,  the  misery  it  occasions,  and  the  moral  degradation  it infallibly  works on all sides -- upon the vanquished and the victor, the party originally in the right and the party in the wrong. In every war  one  party  at  least  must  be  in  the  wrong,  involved  in  the tremendous  guilt  of  unjustifiable  war,  and  in  the  vast  majority  of cases  both  parties  are  in  the  wrong.  No  plea  of  honour,  glory  or aggrandizement, policy or profit, can excuse, much less justify, war; nothing short of necessity to the end of the preservation of national existence. In order to make a war right in God's sight, it is not only necessary that our enemy should aim to do us a wrong, but also (1.) That the wrong he attempts should directly or remotely threaten the national life; and (2.) That war be the only means to avert it. Even in this  case  every  other  means  of  securing  justice  and  maintaining national safety should be exhausted before recourse is had to this last resort. A war may be purely defensive in spirit and intent while it is aggressive in the manner in which it is conducted. The question of right depends upon the former, not the latter -- upon the purpose for which, and not upon the mere order in which, or theatre upon which, the attack is made.</p>
<p>Section  III:  Civil  magistrates  may  not  assume  to  themselves  the administration of the Word and sacraments; or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven;[5] or, in the least, interfere in matters of faith.[6] Yet, as nursing fathers, it is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the church of our common  Lord,  without giving the preference to any denomination of Christians above the rest, in such a manner that all ecclesiastical persons whatever shall enjoy the full, free,  and  unquestioned  liberty  of  discharging  every  part  of  their sacred functions, without violence or danger.[7] And, as Jesus Christ hath appointed a regular government and discipline in his church, no law of any commonwealth should interfere with, let, or hinder, the due exercise thereof, among the voluntary members of any denomination of Christians, according to their own profession and belief.[8] It is the duty of civil magistrates to protect the person and good name of all their people, in such an effectual manner as that no person be suffered, either upon pretense of religion or of infidelity, to offer  any  indignity,  violence,  abuse,  or  injury  to  any  other  person whatsoever:  and  to  take  order,  that  all  religious  and  ecclesiastical assemblies be held without molestation or disturbance.[9]</p>

<p>IV.

<ol>
<li>Mark 10:42-44; Matt. 23:8-12; II Tim. 2:24; I Peter 5:3</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections teach that the Church and the State are both divine institutions, having different objects and spheres of action, different governments  and  officers,  and  hence,  while  owing  mutual  good offices, are independent of each other. This is opposed --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>To  the  Papal  doctrine  of  the  relation  of  the  State  to  the  Church. According to the strictly logical ultramontane view, the whole nation being in all its members a portion of the Church universal, the civil organization  is  comprehended  within  the  Church  for  certain  ends subordinate  to  the  great  end  for  which  the  Church  exists,  and  is therefore ultimately responsible to it for the exercise of the authority delegated.  Hence,  whenever  the  Pope  has  been  in  a  condition  to vindicate his authority, he has put kingdoms  under  interdict, released subjects from their vow of allegiance, and deposed sovereigns because of the assumed heresy or insubordination of the civil rulers of the land. Our Confession teaches that the State is in its sphere  entirely  independent  of  the  Church,  and  that  it  has  civil jurisdiction  over  all  ecclesiastical  persons,  on  the  same  principles and  to  the  same  extent  it  has  over  any  other  class  of  persons whatsoever.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The statements of these sections are opposed also to the Erastian doctrine  as  to  the  relation  of  the  State  to  the  Church,  which  has prevailed  in  all  the  nations  and  national  churches  of  Europe.  This doctrine regards the State as a divine institution, designed to provide for all the wants of men, spiritual as well as temporal, and that it is consequently charged with the duty of providing for the dissemination of pure doctrine and for the proper administration of the sacraments and of discipline. It is the duty of the civil magistrate, therefore, to support the Church, to appoint its officers, to define its laws,  and  to  superintend  their  administration.  Thus  in  the  State Churches of  Protestant  Germany  and  England  the  sovereign  is  the supreme  ruler  of  the  Church  as  well  as  of  the  State,  and  the  civil magistrate  has  chosen  and  imposed  the  confessions  of  faith,  the system of government, the order of worship, and the entire course of ecclesiastical administration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In opposition to this, our Confession teaches that religious liberty is an  inalienable  prerogative  of  mankind  (chapter  xx.),  and  that  it involves the unlimited right upon the part of every man to worship God  according  to the dictates of his own  conscience. Hence, ecclesiastical rulers,  although  endowed  with  the  power  of  the  keys, are not allowed to apply any civil pains or disabilities to coerce men to  obey  the  laws  they  administer.  Hence,  also,  the  civil  magistrate, while bound to protect church members and ecclesiastical organizations in the peaceful enjoyment of their rights and discharge of  their  functions,  is  nevertheless  allowed  no  official  jurisdiction whatever in the affairs of the Church. The same person may be a civil magistrate and a church member. In the one case he is a ruler -- in the other a subject. Or the same person may be a civil magistrate and a church officer, and rule at the same time in both spheres. But his jurisdiction  in  each  case  would  have  entirely  independent grounds, objects, spheres, modes and subjects of operation.</p>
<p>These sections also teach that obedience to civil magistrates,  when making or executing laws within the proper sphere of the State, is a duty  binding  upon  all  the  subjects  of  government  for  conscience' sake by the authority of God. This follows directly from the fact, as before shown, that civil government is an ordinance of God -- that the  powers  that  be  are  ordained  of  God  for  certain  ends;  hence obedience to them is obedience to God. It follows hence -- (1.) That this obedience ought to be from the heart and for conscience' sake, and not of constraint. Hence we will pray for and voluntarily assist our rulers, as well as render mere technical obedience. (2.) Rebellion is a  grievous  sin,  since  it  is  disobedience  to  God,  and  since  it necessarily works such permanent physical ruin and social demoralization among our fellow-men. The limit of this obligation to obedience  will  be  found  only  when  we  are  commanded  to  do something contrary to the superior authority of God (Acts iv. 19; v. 29);  or  when  the  civil  government  has  become  so  radically  and incurably corrupt that it has ceased to accomplish the ends for which it was  established. When  that  point has unquestionably been reached,  when  all  means  of  redress  have  been  exhausted  without avail,  when  there  appears  no  prospect  of  securing  reform  in  the government,  itself, and  some  good  prospect  of  securing  it by revolution, then it is the privilege and duty of a Christian people to change their  government  --  peacefully  if  they  may,  forcibly  if  they must.</p>

<li>That  marriage  was  ordained.  of  God,  and  is  therefore  a  divine institution, involving a religious as well as a civil contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The ends designed to be promoted by marriage are specified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It  is  affirmed  that  the  law  of  marriage  allows  it  to  be  contracted only between one man and one woman, and that a man can have but one wife and a woman but one husband at the same time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  pre-eminent  sanctity  of  a  life  of  celibacy  is  denied,  and  the lawfulness of marriage for all classes of men is affirmed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is taught that persons of different religions should not intermarry,  and  that  true  believers  should  not  be  unequally  yoked with the ungodly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Marriage was ordained of God, and is therefore a divine institution.  This  is  so  --  (1.)  Because  God  created  man  male  and female,  and  so  constituted  them,  physically  and  morally,  that  they are mutually adapted to each other and are mutually helpful to each other under the law of marriage, and not otherwise; and (2.) Because the law of marriage, the conditions of its contract, continuance and dissolution, are laid down in the Word of God.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence it follows that marriage is a religious as well as a civil contract. No  State  has  any  right  to  change  the  law  of  marriage,  or  the conditions upon which it, may be lawfully constituted or dissolved, as these have been ordained by God. Neither has any man or woman a  right  to  contract  any  relation  different  in  any  respect,  as  to  its character or duration, from that which God  has ordained as marriage. Hence marriage is a human contract under the limits and sanctions of a divine constitution, and the parties contracting pledge their vows of truth and constancy to God as well as to each other and to society.</p>
<p>But it is also a civil contract, because every State is bound to protect the foundations upon which social order reposes, and every marriage involves  many  obvious  civil  obligations  and  leads  to  many  civil consequences  touching  property,  the  custody  of  children,  etc.  The State must therefore define the nature and civil effects of marriage, and prescribe conditions upon which and modes in which it shall be publicly acknowledged and ratified or dissolved. It is of the highest importance that the laws of the State do not contravene the laws of God  upon  this  subject,  but  be  made  in  all  respects  to  conform  to them. In all cases of such conflict Christians and Christian ministers must obey God rather than men. In Great Britain the civil authorities have  transgressed  the  authority  of  God  in  this  matter,  chiefly  by declaring marriages, really binding in God's sight, to be null and void ab initio, because of some trivial illegality as to the time in which or the persons by whom it was solemnized. In this country [America] the sin is chiefly committed in the matter of allowing the marriage bond to be dissolved for many causes not recognized as valid in the Word of God. The law of the land is to be obeyed for conscience sake whenever  it  does  not  contravene  the  higher  law  of  God.  When  it plainly  does  so,  then  Christian  men  and  church  sessions  are  to  act themselves  and  to  treat others just as if the ungodly  human enactment had no existence, and then take the consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The main ends designed to be promoted by marriage are stated to be -- (1.) The mutual help of husband and wife. (2.) The increase of mankind with a legitimate issue. (3.) The increase of the Church of Christ with a holy seed. (4.) The prevention of uncleanness.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  law  of  God  makes  marriage  a  contract  for  life  between  one man and one woman. The proof of this is as follows: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.)  God  instituted  marriage  at  first  between  one  man  and  one woman.</li>
<li>(2.) He has providentially preserved in all ages and among all nations an equal number of births of each sex.</li>
<li>(3.)  Experience  shows  that  physically,  economically,  and  morally, polygamy defeats all the ends for which marriage was designed, and is  inconsistent  with  human  nature  and  the  relations  of  the  sexes, while monogamy proves in the highest degree adapted to effect those ends.</li>
<li>(4.) This original law of God and of nature is of course dispensable in special  cases  and  under  peculiar  conditions  by  the  Lawgiver;  and whenever, and to whatsoever extent, it is thus dispensed it ceases to be binding, and its non-observance ceases to be sin. Thus Moses, as God's agent, allowed a dispensation of this law of monogamy, which had been long disregarded among the ancestors of the Israelites, "but from the beginning it was not so." Matt. xix. 8.</li>
<li>(5.)  Christ  expressly  withdraws  this  dispensation,  and  restores  the law of marriage to its original basis: " Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth  adultery:  and  whoso  marrieth  her  which  is  put  away doth commit adultery." Matt. xix. 9. It is  obvious  that  it  is  not  the putting away a wife improperly, but it is the marrying another before she is dead, that is the act of adultery. And on the woman's side the adultery cannot consist in being put away, but in marrying another man while her husband lives. Hence for a man to have two wives, or a woman two husbands, living at the same time, divorced or not, is adultery, with the sole exceptions noted above.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Our  Confession  teaches  that  marriage  is  lawful  for  all  sorts  of people  who  have  intelligence  sufficient  to  consent.  The  Romish Church allows that marriage is lawful for the great mass of men as a concession to the weakness of the flesh, but maintains that a life of celibacy is both meritorious and more  conducive to spiritual elevation. Hence they say a life of celibacy is recommended by Christ (Matt. xix. 10-12) as one of his evangelical counsels, by-the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>observance  of  which  supererogatory  merit  may  be  attained;  and hence the Romish Church imposes it as a universal and imperative obligation upon its clergy.</p>
<p>This all Protestants deny for the following reasons: -(1.) God created man male and female, and constituted the relation of  the  sexes,  and  ordained  marriage  in  Paradise  when  man  was innocent. Marriage, therefore, must be purely good, and a means of good in itself, except when abused by man.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) The relation is honoured in being selected as the highest earthly type of the grandest heavenly fact -- namely, the mystical  union  of the  eternal  Word  with  his  Bride  the  Church.  Eph.  v.  28  --  33.  (3.) Reason and experience unite in showing that the relation is the best conceivable condition for the bringing out and educating the noblest moral instincts and faculties of human nature. The best and noblest men of the Old World and the New have been formed in the family.</li>
<li>(4.) The vast experiment of celibacy on the part of the priesthood and of the monastic houses of the Roman Church proves our position by showing the impoverishing and degrading tendency of the opposite system. The true meaning of what is taught by our Saviour, Matt. xix. 10  --  12,  and  by  Paul,  1  Cor,  vii.  1-40,  is,  that  the  unmarried  are exposed  to  less  worldly  care  than  the  married;  therefore,  that  in times of persecution and public danger, and with reference to some special  kind  of  service  to  which  God  providentially  calls  a  man,  it may  be  both  his  interest  and  his  duty  not  to  marry.  It  appears evident  that,  even  in  the  present  age,  some  kinds  of  missionary service both at home  and abroad might be more efficiently accomplished  for  the  glory  of  God  and  the  good  of  men  if  our younger  ministers  would  consent  to  regard  marriage  as  less  than absolutely essential, and in this respect also "seek' first the kingdom of God and his righteousness."</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  principle  that  professors  of  the  true  should  not  intermarry with professors of a false religion, and that true believers should not</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>intermarry with the ungodly, touches not that which is essential  to the validity of marriage, but that which belongs to its perfection, and brings in question not the reality of the marriage when formed, but the propriety of forming it. Paul teaches that if one of the parties of a previous  marriage  becomes  a  Christian,  the  other  remaining  a heathen,  the  Christian  brother  or  sister  remains  bound  by  the marriage-tie as before, unless the heathen party voluntarily abandon them, and so dissolve the relation, when the Christian is no longer bound. 1 Cor. vii. 12 -- 15. On the same principle, the marriages  at present so common between the converted and the unconverted are unquestionably valid, and to be respected as such.</p>
<p>It nevertheless remains true that true Christians owe it both to Christ and to their own souls not to contract such alliances. For how can one who possesses the mind and the spirit of Christ, whose affections are  as  a  practical  fact  set  upon  things  above,  whose  motives,  aims and aspirations are heavenly, become one flesh and heart, dwell in the  most  intimate  of  all  possible  communion,  with  a  soul  dead  in trespasses and sins? (See 2 Cor. vi. 14-18.) If such a union is formed, it must  follow,  either  that  the  sacred  ordinance  of  marriage  is desecrated by a union of bodies where there is no union of hearts, or in the intimate fellowship of soul with soul the believer will be greatly depressed  in  his  inward,  spiritual  life,  and  greatly  hindered  in  his attempts to serve his Master in the world. 1 Cor. vii. 39.</p>
<p>IV. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity forbidden by the Word.[8] Nor can such incestuous marriages  ever  be  made  lawful  by  any  law  of  man  or  consent  of parties,  so  as  those  persons  may  live  together  as  man  and  wife.[9] The man may not marry any of his wife's kindred, nearer in blood then he may of his own: nor the woman of her husband's kindred, nearer in blood than of her own.</p>

<p>V. Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected before  marriage,  giveth  just  occasion  to  the  innocent  party to dissolve that contract.[10] In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce:[11] and, after the divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead.[12]</p>

<p>These sections teach the divine law of marriage as to incest and as to divorce.</p>
<p>l.  INCEST consists of sexual intercourse between parties  forbidden by the divine law to marry, because of their relationship. Marriage between these parties is impossible; and no matter what may be the provisions  of  human  laws  or  the  decisions  of  human  courts,  such pretended marriages are void ab initio -- invalid in essence as well as improper  and  injurious.  Since  the  degrees  of  relationship  within which marriage is excluded differ in nearness, so the crime of incest differs,  according  to  these  varying  degrees,  from  the  highest  to  the least  measure  of  criminality.  The  obligation  to  avoid  intermarriage between near blood-relations is a dictate of nature as well as of the Word of God.</p>
<p>The  only  law  on  this  subject  in  the  Scriptures  is  the  Levitical  law recorded in Lev. xviii. 6 -- 23; xx. 10 -- 21. If this law is still binding, it  carries  with  it  the  principle  that  it  is  incest  for  a  man  to  cohabit with any one of his deceased wife's relations nearer in blood. than it is  lawful  for  him  to  do  of  his  own.  If  this  law  is  not  binding  now, there is no other law of God remaining on the subject of incest except the law of nature.</p>
<p>The Greek and Roman Catholic Churches agree in holding that this law is still binding, since the reason of the law rests upon permanent relationships,  and  not  upon  any  special  circumstances  peculiar  to society  among  the  Jews.  All  branches  of  the  Protestant  Church  -Episcopal, Lutheran, and Presbyterian -- have maintained the same principle in their Confessions of Faith or canons of discipline. It is asserted in these sections of our Confession. But a great diversity of sentiment  and  practice  prevails in different parts of our [the American]  Church,  on  this  subject,  and  for  the  most  part  the enforcement  of  this  rule  has  been  left  to  the  discretion  of  the majority of each local church court. Several efforts have been made, in 1826 and 1827, and 1843, 1845, and 1847, to have this section of this chapter changed, but without effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The divine law as to DIVORCE is, that marriage is a contract for life  between  one  man  and  one  woman,  and  that  it  is,ipso  facto, dissolved  only  by  death  (Rom.  vii.  2,  8);  and  that  the  only  causes upon which any civil authority can dissolve the union of those whom God has joined together are (a.) adultery, (b.) willful, causeless, and incurable desertion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) The only causes upon which it is lawful to grant a divorce are -(a.) adultery; this is explicitly allowed by Christ Matt. v. 31, 32; xix. 9); and  (b.)  willful, causeless,  and  incurable  desertion.  This  is allowed by Paul to the Christian husband, or wife deserted by their heathen partner.  1  Cor.  vii.  15.  The  reason  in  the  case  is  also  selfevident, since such desertion,  being  total  and  incurable,  makes  the</li>
</ul>
<p>marriage  an  empty  name,  void  of  all  reality;  and,  being  causeless, leaves the deserting party without remaining rights to be defended.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) Such causes, however, do not, ipso facto, dissolve the marriage bond, but only give the right to the innocent party, if they so elect, to demand that it shall be dissolved by competent authority. And if they do demand the dissolution, they are not left to their own discretion in the case, but they must seek for the vindication of their rights at the hands of the public authorities and according to the law of the land.</li>
<li>(3.) The civil law, however, has no authority to grant divorces upon any other grounds than those above defined as allowed by the law of God.  Whenever  they  do  so,  as  is  constantly  done  in  fact,  the  civil authorities put themselves into direct conflict with the law of God in the case. Hence all Christians and church courts are bound in such cases to disregard the judgment of the civil authority, and to regard and treat such unlawful divorces as null and void. And if the parties to  a  marriage  unrighteously  dissolved  marry  again,  they  are  to  be regarded and treated by those who fear God as living in those new marriages in the sin of adultery. Matt. xix. 8, 9; Acts iv. 19; v. 29.</li>

<p>SECTION  I.  The  catholic  or  universal  church,  which  is  invisible, consists  of  the  whole  number  of  the  elect,  that  have  been,  are,  or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.[1]</p>

</ol>
<p>SECTION II. The visible church, which is also catholic or universal under  the  gospel  (not  confined  to  one  nation,  as  before  under  the law), consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion;[2] and of their children:[3] and is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ,[4] the house and family of God,[5] out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation.[6]</p>

<p>SECTION III. Unto this catholic visible church Christ hath given the ministry,  oracles,  and  ordinances  of  God,  for  the  gathering  and perfecting of the saints, in this life, to the end of the world: and doth, by his own presence and Spirit, according to his promise, make them effectual thereunto.

<li>I Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11-13; Matt. 28:19-20; Isa. 59:12</li>
</ol>
<p>THE word catholic means universal, and therefore is the proper title of the true Church of Christ, viewed as one body, composed of many members, existing in different places and at different times; and is consequently very improperly applied to that corrupt and schismatical body, the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>The word in the New Testament corresponding to the English word church  is  ecclesia  (ekklesia);  this  is  derived  from  the  word  calein (kalein),  to  call,  to  call  out,  and  thus  constitute  a  separate  body; which word is used to express the effectual  call  of  the  Holy  Spirit, whereby  he  brings  dead  souls  to  life  in  the  world  of  regeneration. Rom. viii, 28 -- 30; 1 Pet. ii. 9; v. 10. The word " church," therefore, is a collective term including the whole body of the " called " (kletoi) or the " elect " (eklektoi), or of " believers." Rev. xvii. 14; 1 Cor. i. 2, 24.</p>
<p>To this Church, or collective body of the "effectually called," all the promises of the Gospel are addressed. It is said to be the "pillar and ground  of  the  truth  "  (1  Tim.  iii,  15);  the  "body"  and  "fulness  of Christ" (Eph. i. 22, 23); "the Bride, the Lamb's wife" (Rev. xxi. 2, 9); and it is affirmed that "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Matt. xvi. 18</p>
<p>As every part of this entire body possesses the common nature of the whole, the common term " Church " is naturally applied sometimes to the entire body, of all nations and ages, conceived of as a unit (Col. i. 18); and sometimes to the church of a particular province or city, as "the  church  of  the  Thessalonians,"  or  "the  church  of  Ephesus  "  (2 Thess.  i.  1;  Rev.  ii.  1);  or  in  the  plural  for  the  several  individual churches of a province, as "the churches in Asia," or " the churches of Macedonia," or of " Galatia" (1 Cor. xvi. 1; 2 Cor. viii. 1; Rev. i. 4); and sometimes the word is applied to designate some Christian family, as</p>
<p>" the church in the house of Priscilla and Aquila." Rom. xvi. 5; Col. iv. 15; Philem. 2.</p>
<p>Our Confession teaches in these sections --</p>
<ol>
<li>That there is a collective body, comprising all the elect of God of all nations  and  generations,  called  the  Church  invisible.  The  fact  that there is such a body must be believed by every person who believes that  all  men,  of  every  age  and  nation  since  Adam,  who  received Christ and experienced the power of his redemption, are to be saved, and that all who reject him will be lost. That this entire body in its ideal  completeness,  not  one  true  member  wanting,  not  one  false member marring its symmetry, has been constantly present  to  the mind  of  God  from  eternity,  must  be  believed  by  all  persons  who acknowledge either or both the divine foreknowledge and foreordination.</li>
</ol>
<p>This  body,  thus  seen  in  its  absolute  fulness  and  perfection  by  God from  eternity,  will  be  at  last  revealed  to  the  universe  in  all  its completeness and glory, so that it will transcend all the other works of God in its visible excellences. And it is seen in part by us now in the successive ages as it is gathered in, because every member of it is a man or woman living and acting in the world, and the spiritual life whereby  they  are  constituted  members  of  the  Church  makes  itself manifest by its fruits. This Church is called "invisible," however, (1.) Because the portions of it at any time or place visible are immeasurably small in comparison with the body as a whole in its full  complement  of  saints  of  all  nations  and  generations;  and  (2.) Because even in the sections of this body visible to us its outlines are very uncertain. Many who appear as parts of it do not really belong to  it,  and  many  may  really  belong  to  it  whose  union  with  it  is  not manifest. The lines are not to human eye drawn with any degree of accuracy  between  the  Church  and  the  world.  In  the  meantime,  the true Church, not yet perfectly developed and manifested, lurks in the phenomenal Church, as the  grain  of  the  growing  corn  lurks  in  the ear,  and  in  this  sense  it  is  invisible.  For  that  which  constitutes  the essence  of  this  Church  is  not  the  visible  profession  or  fruitfulness, but  that  invisible  indwelling  divine  life,  from  which  the  profession and the fruitfulness proceed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These  sections  teach  that  there  is  also  a  catholic  or  universal visible  Church,  consisting  of  those  of  every  nation  who  profess  the true religion, together with their children. This proposition involves - (1.) The truth that the true Church, consisting of persons, a part of whom are always living, and, with more or less faithfulness, bringing forth visible fruits of holiness on the earth, of course is itself always in  part,  and  with  greater  or  less  clearness,  visible.  The  universal visible  Church  is  therefore  not  a  different  Church  from  that  which has  just  been  described  as  invisible.  It  is  the  same  body,  as  its successive  generations  pass  in  their order  and  are  imperfectly discriminated from the rest of mankind by the eye of man. (2.) The truth  that  God  has  commanded  his  people  to  organize  themselves into  distinct  visible  ecclesiastical  communities,  with  constitutions, laws  and  officers,  badges,  ordinances  and  discipline,  for  the  great purpose  of  giving  visibility  to  his  kingdom,  of  making  known  the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized communities which is faithful to the great King is an integral part of the visible Church; and all together, of all names and nations, constitute the catholic or universal visible Church. The conditions of human life, physical, political, and social, and  the  imperfections  of  Christians,  render  impossible  a  practical organic union of all these organized bodies; yet that they all are one visible Church is self-evident, from the fact that they are all visible parts of the true spiritual or invisible Church, which, being "the body of  Christ,"  can  never  be  divided.  (3.)  The  truth  also  that  since  the Church is rendered visible by the profession and outward obedience of its members; and since no class of men are ever endowed with the power of discriminating with absolute  accuracy  the  genuineness  of Christian characteristics, it necessarily follows that a credible profession,  as  presumptive  evidence  of  real  religion,  constitutes  a person a member of the visible Church. By a credible profession is meant  a  profession  of  the  true  religion  sufficiently  intelligent  and sufficiently  corroborated  by  the  daily  life  of  the  professor  to  be credited as genuine. Every such profession is ground  for the presumption that  the  person  is  a  member  of  the  true  Church,  and consequently  constitutes  him  a  member  of  the  visible  Church,  and lays an obligation upon all other Christians to regard and treat him accordingly. This visible Church is called "the kingdom of heaven" on the earth; and its nature and progress are set forth in the parables of the  "sower  and  the  seed,"  the  "wheat  and  the  tares,"  the  "mustard seed," the "leaven," the "net which was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind," etc. Matt. xiii. (4.) Also the truth that the children of  all  professors  of  the  true  religion  are,  on  that  account,  fellowmembers  with  their  parents  of  the  visible  Church.  This  important principle  will  properly  come  up  for  discussion  and  proof  under chapter xxviii. section 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These  sections  teach  that  God  has  given  to  this  universal  visible Church,  in  all  its  branches  and  constituent  elements  --  (1.)  The inspired  Scriptures  as  an  infallible  oracle  and  rule  of  faith  and practice;  (2.)  The  Gospel  ministry  --  an  order  not  qualified  and indicated by manual contact, but by the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost;  (3.)  The  ordinances,  such  as  preaching,  prayer,  singing  of praise, and the holy sacraments of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, and discipline. And (4.) That the great end designed to be accomplished by this grant is (a.) the gathering in of the elect from the children of the Church or from the world, and (b.) the perfecting of the saints when thus gathered. Eph. iv. 11 -- 13. And (5.) That the success  of  these  agencies  in  attaining  this  end  is  secured  beyond peradventure by the promise of Christ to be with them and to render them effectual until the end of the world. Matt. xxviii. 20.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These sections teach that out of the bounds of this universal visible Church there is no ordinary possibility of salvation. This proposition is  believed by our Church and by all other evangelical Christians to apply only to adults who are out of the pale of the visible Church. A11 the members of the human race dying in infancy are believed to be saved through the merits of Christ. Since, then, the universal visible Church consists of all the professors of the true religion in the world, to say that out of it there is ordinarily no possibility of salvation is only  saying  --  (1.)  That  God  has  never  in  any  way  revealed  his intention of saving any sane adult destitute of the personal knowledge  of  Christ.  (2.) That  an  unexceptional  experience  in heathen  lands  leads  us  to  the  conviction  that  none  in  such  a condition  are  saved.  (3.)  That  God  has  very  emphatically  declared that those who deny his Son before men shall not be saved. Matt. x. 33.  (4.)  That  every  man  who  hears  the  gospel  is  commanded  to confess  Christ  before  men  --  that  is,  to  become  a  public,  visible professor of the true religion. Matt. x. 32. The conditions of salvation laid  down  in  Rom.  x.  9,  10  are  --"  If  thou  shalt  confess  with  thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe with thy heart that God hath raised  him  from  the  dead,  thou  shalt  be  saved.  For  with  the  heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made  unto  salvation."  There  are  obviously  various  ways  in  which Christ  may  be  publicly  acknowledged  and  confessed.  In  some  way every person having the love of Christ in his heart will confess him. But  our  Confession  intends  in  these  sections  to  teach  further  that ordinarily,  where  there  is  the  knowledge  and  opportunity,  God requires every one who loves Christ to confess him in the regular way of joining the community of his people and of taking the sacramental badges  of  his  discipleship.  That  this  is  commanded  will  be  shown under  chapters  xxvii.-xxix.  And  that  when  providentially  possible every Christian heart will be prompt to obey in this matter, is selfevident.  When  shame  or  fear  of  persecution  is  the  preventing consideration,  then  the  failure  to  obey  is  equivalent  to  the  positive rejection of Christ, since the rejection of him will have to be publicly pretended in such case in order to avoid the consequences attending upon the public acknowledgment of him.</p>

<p>SECTION  IV.  This  catholic  church  hath  been  sometimes  more, sometimes  less visible.[8] And  particular churches, which are members thereof, are more or less pure, according as the doctrine of the  gospel  is  taught  and  embraced,  ordinances  administered,  and public worship performed more or less purely in them.[9]</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>All that is taught in these sections necessarily follows from what we have above ascertained as to the nature of the visible Church: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since  the  catholic  or  universal  visible  Church  consists  of  all  the professors of the true religion in the world, and of all the particular ecclesiastical  organizations  which  continue  loyal  to  the  Head,  and maintain doctrines essentially sound, it must necessarily follow that the  Church  as  a  whole  is  in  any  age  more  or  less  visible,  and  any particular constituent church more or less pure in proportion -- (1.) To  the  purity  of  the  doctrine  they  profess  and  the  worship  they maintain; (2.) To their zeal and spiritual character and energy; and (3.) To the purity of their membership maintained by discipline.  In proportion  as  these  are  all  advanced  in  perfection,  and  prevail generally  throughout  the  whole  body,  in  the  same  degree  will  the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>entire Church appear more visibly discriminated from the world and manifest in her entire outline. In the same measure, also, will every individual  ecclesiastical  organization  be  pure  --  that  is,  free  from heterogeneous elements -- and consecrated to the accomplishment of the ends for which it is designed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It follows, also, from the very nature of the visible Church and its condition in this world, that its purity is a matter of degree, varying at different times and in different sections. The teaching of Scripture as  to  the  nature  of  the  kingdom  under  the  present  dispensation (Matt.  xiii.),  the  nature  of  man  yet  imperfectly  sanctified,  and  the universal experience of the churches, lead us to the conclusion that the very purest churches are yet very imperfect, and will continue so to  the  end,  and  that  some  will  become  so  corrupt  as  to  lose  their character  as  true  churches  of  Christ  altogether.  This  was  the  case with the ancient Church under the reign of Ahab, when the children of Israel had apostatized from the service of the true God to such an extent that Elijah thought he was the only one left faithful. Even in that  state  of  affairs  the  Lord  declared,  "Yet  I  have  left  me  seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal." 1 Kings xix.  18.  Even  more  entire  deterioration  has  happened  to  the ancient  churches  founded  by  the  apostles  in  the  East  and  by  their successors in Northern Africa. The churches which acknowledge the supremacy  of  the  Bishop  of  Rome  have  abandoned  the  faith  and obscured  the  glory  of  their  Lord  in  one  direction,  while  many professedly  Protestant  churches  --  as  the  English  and  American Socinians  and  the  German  Rationalists  --  have  made  an  equal apostasy in another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Church of Rome maintains that the promise of Christ secures the infallible orthodoxy and purity of the visible organization, in subjection to apostolically-ordained bishops, to the end of the world. But the Church whose infallible orthodoxy and purity is guaranteed by the divine promise is no outward visible organization or succession  of  bishops  or  priests;  it  is  the  particular  Church  of  no nation or generation, but it is the true invisible body of the elect or of true  believers  of  all  nations  and  ages.  That  it  is  so  is  proved  --  (1.) From the fact that for eighteen hundred years the promise has been fulfilled in the sense we have defined, but has never been fulfilled in the  sense  the  Romish  Church  demands.  They  have  themselves  led the  defection  from  the  faith  and  practice  of  the  apostolic  Church. And  among  Romanists  and  Protestants  alike,  visible  ecclesiastical organizations are continually changing their characters and relations to  the  truth.  (2.)  Several  of  the  Epistles  are  addressed  to  "the Church," and the salutations explain that phrase by the equivalents "the called," "the saints," etc. See the salutations of First and Second Corinthians,  Ephesians,  Colossians,  First  and  Second  Peter,  and Jude. The same attributes are ascribed to the members of the true Church in the body of the Epistles. 1 Cor. i. 30; iii. 16; vi. 11; Eph. ii. 3 --  8,  19  --  22;  Col.  i.  21,  22;  ii.  10;  1  Pet.  ii.  9.  (3.)  The  attributes ascribed to the true Church prove it to be spiritual, and, in the sense explained, invisible, and not an outward organized succession. Eph. v. 27; 1 Pet. ii. 5; John x. 27; Col. i. 18, 24.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It follows, nevertheless, from the relation which the visible Church sustains  to  the  invisible  Church,  that  since,  according  to  divine promise, the latter can never entirely fail from the earth (Matt. xvi. 18), so likewise, however the former may be obscured by heresies or lessened by defection, it can never be entirely wanting. Wherever the true  Church  is,  it  will  be  more  or  less  visible;  not  in  proportion, however, to the size or pretension of the organization with which it may be associated, but in proportion to the purity of its faith and the spiritual activity and fruitfulness of its membership.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the Lord Jesus Christ is the only absolute and supreme Head of  the  Church  is  self-evident,  is  abundantly  asserted  in  Scripture (Col. i. 18, and Zph. i. 20 -- 23), and has never been denied by any Christians.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many have, however, maintained that, as the visible Church on earth has a government and laws, and since these must be administered by a visible authority, so the Church must have an earthly visible head, acting upon authority delegated by Christ and is his representative. The Church of Rome claims this for the Pope: "So has Christ -- the Head and Spouse -- placed over his Church, which he governs by his most inward Spirit, a man to be the vicar and minister of his power; for as a visible church requires a visible head, our Saviour appointed Peter head and pastor of all the faithful." Cat. Rom., part i. ch. x., q. 11.</p>
<p>The  Erastian  State  Churches  of  Germany  and  Great  Britain  have acknowledged  their  respective  sovereigns  as  supreme  heads  of  the Church  as  well  as  of  the  State.  Henry  VIII.  was  recognized  as "supreme head of the Church of England," and it was enacted "That the king, his heirs, etc., shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England, called Anglicana Ecclesia;  and  shall  have  and  enjoy,  annexed  and  united  to  the imperial crown of this realm, as well the style and title thereof, as all honours, dignities, immunities, profits and commodities to the said dignity of supreme head of the said. Church belonging and appertaining." 26 Henry VIII., cap. i. This supremacy of the reigning sovereign  over  the  Church  is  even  made  an  article  of  faith,  being incorporated  into  the  Thirty-  seventh  Article  of  the  Church  of England: "The Queen's majesty has the chief power in this realm of England, and other her dominions; unto whom the chief government of all estates of this realm, whether they be ecclesiastical or civil, in all causes doth appertain."</p>
<p>In  both  these  cases,  and  in  all  cases  of  like  claims  to  ecclesiastical supremacy, it is a mere question of fact and evidence. If, as a matter of  fact,  Christ  delegated  his  authority  either  to  the  Pope  or  to national Sovereigns, and made them, as his victors, visible heads of his  Church,  then  we  ought  to  obey  them,  and  our  disobedience  is treason  to  Christ.  On  the  contrary,  if  they  have  no  such  authority, and are unable to prove their claims by unquestionable credentials, then  their  assumption  of  such  power  is  a  blasphemous  intrusion upon  divine  prerogatives  and  treason  to  the  human  race.  It  is obvious  that  neither  party  can  show  any  plausible  foundation  for their  claims,  and  that  upon  the  slightest  interrogation  they  fall  of their own weight.</p>
<p>In the absence of any duly accredited visible head of the Church, we are forced back to direct dependence for law and its administration, as well as for redemption, upon the great invisible Head. He presides over  and  governs  his  Church  --  (1.)  Through  his  inspired  Word, which is,  as  we  have  seen,  an  infallible,  complete,  and  perspicuous rule  of  faith  and  practice.  (2.)  Through  the  apostolical  institutions transmitted  to  us,  as  the  ministry,  the  sacraments,  the  ordinances, etc. Eph. iv. 11. And (3.) Through his own spiritual presence, which extends  to  all  his  members,  and  endures  to  the  end  of  the  world. Matt. xviii. 20; xxviii. 20.</p>
<p>The word "Antichrist" occurs in the New Testament in 1 John ii. 18, 22;  iv.  3;  2  John  7.  The  coming  of  the  "man  of  sin,"  the  "son  of perdition," is predicted in 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4. Interpreters have differed as  to  whether  these  phrases  were  intended  to  designate  a  personal opponent of the Lord, or principles and systems antagonistic to him and  his  cause.  The  authors  of  our  Confession  can  hardly  have intended to declare that each individual Pope of the long succession is  the  personal  Antichrist,  and  they  probably  meant  that  the  Papal system is in spirit, form, and effect, wholly antichristian, and that it marked  a  defection from  apostolical Christianity foreseen and foretold in Scripture. All of which was true in their day, and is true in ours. We have need, however, to remember that as the forms of evil change, and the complications of the kingdom of Christ with that of Satan  vary  with  the  progress  of  events,  "even  now  are  there  many Antichrists." 1 John ii. 18.</p>

<p>SECTION I. All saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by his  Spirit,  and  by  faith,  have  fellowship  with  him  in  his  graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory:[1] and, being united to one another  in  love,  they  have  communion  in  each  other's  gifts  and graces,[2] and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.[3]</p>

<p>SECTION  II.  Saints  by  profession  are  bound  to  maintain  an  holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification;[4] as also  in  relieving  each  other  in  outward  things,  according  to  their several abilities and necessities.

<p>COMMUNION is a mutual  interchange  of  offices  between  parties, which flows from a common principle in which they are united. The nature  and  degree  of  the  communion  will  depend  upon  the  nature and intimacy of the union from which it proceeds.</p>

</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>All saints are united to the Lord Jesus. We need to know what is the  foundation  and  what  is  the  nature  of  this  union,  and  how  it  is established.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.)  As  to  the  foundation  of  the  union  subsisting  between  the  true believer and the Lord Jesus, the Scriptures teach that it rests in the eternal  purpose  of  the  Triune  God,  expressed  in  the  decree  of election  (we  were  "chosen  in  him  before  the  foundation  of  the world," Eph. i. 4), and the eternal covenant of grace formed between the  Father  and  his  Word  as  the  mediatorial  head  of  his  people, treating  with  the  Head  for  the  members,  and  with the members in the Head, and providing for their salvation in him. John xvii. 2, 6.</li>
<li>(2.)  As  to  the  nature  of  this  union  of  the  believer  with  Christ,  the Scriptures teach -- (a.) That it is federal and representative, whereby Christ acts in all things as our federal Head, in our stead, and for our benefit. Hence our legal status is determined by his, and his rights, honours, relations, all are made ours in copartnership with him. (b.) That it is a vital and spiritual union. Its actuating source and bond is the Spirit of the Head, who dwells and works in the members. 1 Cor. vi. 17; xii. 13; 1 John iii. 24; iv. 13. Hence our spiritual life is derived from him and sustained and determined by his life, which we share. Gal.  ii.  20.  (c.)  That  it  is  a  union  between  our  entire  persons  and Christ, and therefore one involving our bodies through our souls. 1 Cor. vi. 15, 19.</li>
<li>(3.) As  to  the  manner  in  which  this  union  is  established,  the Scriptures  teach  that  the  elect,  having  been  in  the  divine  idea</li>
</ul>
<p>comprehended  under  the  headship  of  Christ  from  eternity,  are  in time actually united to him -- (a.) By the powerful operation of his Spirit, whereby they are " quickened together with Christ" Eph. ii. 5); which  Spirit  evermore  dwells  in  them  as  the  organ  of  Christ's presence with them, the infinite medium through which the fulness of his love and life, and all the benefits purchased by his blood, pass over freely from the Head to the members. (b.) By the actings of faith upon their part, whereby they grasp Christ and appropriate him and his  grace  to  themselves,  and  whereby  they  ever  continue  to  live  in him and to draw their resources from him. Eph. iii. 17.</p>
<p>This  union  is  illustrated  in  Scripture  by  the  relation  subsisting between a foundation and its superstructure (1 Pet. ii. 4 -- 6); a, tree and its branches (John xv. 5); the members of the body and the head (Eph. iv. 15, 16); a husband and wife (Eph. v. 31, 32); Adam and his descendants. Rom. v. 12-19.</p>
<p>This  union  has  been  called  by  theologians  a  "  mystical"  union, because, it never could have been known unless revealed by the Lord himself,  and  because  it  is  so  incomparably  intimate  and  excellent that  it  transcends  all  other  unions  of  which  we  have  experience. Nevertheless  it  is  not  mysterious  in  the  sense  of  involving  any confusion between Christ's personality and ours, nor does it make us in any wise partakers of his Godhead or to be equal with him in any respect.  It  is  a  union  between  persons  in  which  each  retains  his separate identity, and in which the believer, although immeasurably exalted  and  blessed,  nevertheless  is  entirely  subordinated  to  and continues dependent upon his Lord.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>On  the  basis of this union  a most  intimate fellowship or interchange of mutual offices ever continues to be sustained between believers and Christ.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) They have fellowship with Christ (a.) In all the covenant merits of his active and passive obedience. Forensically they are " complete in him." Col. ii. 10. His Father, his inheritance, his throne, his crown,</li>
</ul>
<p>are theirs. As their mediatorial Head he acts as prophet, priest, and king. In union with him they are also prophets, priests, and kings. 1 John ii. 27; 1 Peter ii. 5; Rev. iii. 21; v. 10. They have fellowship with Christ also (b.) In the transforming, assimilating power of his life. " Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace." John i. 16. Thus they have the " Spirit," and " the mind" of Christ, and bear his " likeness  "  or  "  image."  Rom.  viii.  9;  Phil.  ii.  5;  1  John  iii.  2.  This includes  the  bodies  also,  making  them  temples  of  the  Holy  Ghost; and in the resurrection our glorified bodies are to be like his. 1 Cor. vi.  19;  xv.  43,  49.  They  have  fellowship  with  Christ  (c.)  In  all  their experiences, inward and outward, in their joys and victories, in their labours, sufferings, temptations, and death. Rom. viii. 37; 2 Cor. xii. 9; Gal. vi. 17; Phil. iii. 10; Heb. xii. 3; 1 Pet. iv. 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.)  Christ  has  fellowship  with  them.  They  belong  to  him  as  the purchase of his blood. They are devoted to his service. They are coworkers  together  with  him  in  building  up  his  kingdom.  They  bear fruit to his praise, and shine as stars in his crown. Their hearts, their lives, their possessions, are all consecrated to him, and are held by them in trust for him. Prov. xix. 17; Rom. xiv. 8; 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since all true believers are thus intimately united to Christ as the common Head of the whole body, and the Source of a common life, it follows that they must be intimately united together. If they have but one  Head,  and  are  all  members  of  one  body,  they  must  have  one common life, and be all members one of another.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Romish and Ritualistic view is, that individuals are united to the Church through the sacraments, and through the Church to Christ. The true view is, that the individual is united to Christ the Head by the Holy Ghost and by faith; and by being united to Christ he is, ipso facto, united to all Christ's members, the Church. The holy catholic Church  is  the  product  of  the  Holy  Ghost.  Wherever  the  Spirit  is, there the Church is. The presence of the Spirit is known by his fruits, which are "love, joy, peace," etc. Gal. v. 22, 23. All believers receiving the same Spirit are by him baptized into " one body;" and thus they all become, " though many members," but " one body," " the body of Christ " and " members in particular." 1 Cor. xii. 13 -- 27.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence true believers, all being united in one living body, sustain many intimate relations,  and  discharge  many  important  offices  for one another, which are summarily expressed by the general phrase, " The communion of saints."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) They have a common Head, and common duties with respect to him; a common profession, a common system of faith to maintain, a common  gospel  to  preach,  a  common  worship  and  service  to maintain.</li>
<li>(2.) They have a common life, and one Holy Ghost dwelling in and binding together in one the whole body. Hence they are involved in the  ties  of  sympathy  and  identity  of  interest.  One  cannot  prosper without  all  prospering  with  him  --  one  cannot  suffer  without  all suffering with him.</li>
<li>(3.) As they constitute one body in the eyes of the world, they have a common reputation, and are all severally and collectively honoured or  dishonoured  with  each  other.  Hence  all  schisms  in  the  body, injurious  controversies,  malignant  representations  of  Christian  by Christian, are self-defaming as well as wicked.</li>
<li>(4.)  The  body  of  saints  is  like  the  natural  body  in  this  also,  that, although  one  body,  each  several  member  is  an  organ  of  the  Holy Ghost for a special function, and has his own individual difference of qualification, and consequently of duty. Hence, in the economy of the body,  each  member  is  to  contribute  his  special  function  and  his special grace or beauty, and has in his turn fellowship in the gifts and complementary graces of all the rest. Eph. iv. 11 -- 16; 1 Cor. xii. 4 -21. This shall be perfectly realized in heaven. John x. 16; xvii. 22.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Since this is the union of all true believers with the Lord and with each  other,  and  since,  consequently,  a  "  communion  of  saints"  so intimate necessarily nourishes among true believers in proportion to</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>their intelligence and their advancement in grace, it follows that all branches  of  the  visible  Church,  and  all  the  individual  members thereof, should do all within their power to act upon the principle of the "communion of saints" in their intercourse with all who profess the  true  religion.  If  the  Church  is  one,  the  churches  are  one.  If  all saints are one, and are embraced in this holy "communion," then all who  profess  to  be  saints  should  regard  and  treat  all  their  fellowprofessors  on  the  presumption  that  they  are  saints  and  "  heirs together  with  them  of  the  grace  of  life."  Think  of  it!  In  spite  of  all controversies and jealousies, one in the eternal electing love of God! -  one  in  the  purchase  of  Christ's  sacrificial  blood!  --  one  in  the beatifying  indwelling  of  the  Holy  Ghost!  --  one  in  the  eternal inheritance of glory! Surely we should be also one in all the charities, sympathies, and helpful offices possible, in these short and evil days of  earthly  pilgrimage.  These  mutual  duties  are,  of  course,  some  of them public -- as between different evangelical churches -- and may of them private and personal. Many of them relate to the souls, and many also to the bodies of the saints. The rule is, the law of love in the  heart,  and  the  principles  and  examples  of  saints  recorded  in Scripture  applied  to  the  special  circumstances  of  every  individual case.  But  while  these  mutual  relations  and  offices  of  the  saints sanctify, they are not designed to supersede the fundamental principles of human society, as the rights of property and the family tie.</p>

<p>SECTION I. Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace,[1] immediately instituted by God,[2] to represent Christ, and his benefits; and to confirm our interest in him:[3] as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the church, and the rest of the world;[4] and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ, according to his Word.[5]</p>

<p>LARGER CATECHISM, q. 168.-- What are the parts of a sacrament? -- The parts of a sacrament are two; the one an outward and sensible sign,  used  according  to  Christ's  own  appointment;  the  other,  an inward and spiritual grace thereby signified. [7]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Matt. iii. 11; 1 Pet. iii. 21.; Rom. ii. 28, 29.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  word  "  sacrament"  does  not  occur  in  the  Scriptures.  In  its classical  usage  it  designated  anything  which  binds  or  brings  under obligations,  as  a  sum  of  money  given  in  pledge,  or  an  oath,  and especially the oath of military allegiance.</p>
<p>In its ecclesiastical usage, the word, while retaining its general sense of  something binding as sacred, was at an early period used as the Latin  equivalent  of  the  Greek  word  mysterion  (musterion},  that which is unknown until revealed; and hence any symbol, type, or rite having a latent spiritual meaning. Hence the word naturally came to be applied in a general and vague sense to the Christian ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and with them also to many other religious doctrines and ordinances.</p>
<p>It  is  plainly,  therefore,  impossible  to  determine  the  nature  or  the number of the sacraments from either the etymology or the usage of the word "sacrament." We want a thorough definition of the thing, not  of  the  name.  This  we  can  get  only  by  taking  Baptism  and  the Lord's Supper, which all men acknowledge to be genuine sacraments, and,  by  a  strict  examination  of  their  origin,  nature,  and  uses, determine (a.) the true character of the class of ordinances to which they  belong,  and  (b.)  whether  any  other  ordinances  belong  to  the same class or not. In this way the definition of a sacrament given in our  Standards  was  formed.  This  definition  involves  the  following points: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A  sacrament is an ordinance immediately instituted by Christ. L. Cat., q. 162, and S. Cat., q. 92.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A  sacrament always consists of two elements -- (1.) An outward, sensible sign; and (2.) An inward, spiritual grace, thereby signified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The sign in every sacrament is sacramentally united to the grace which  it  signifies;  and  out  of  this  union  the  Scriptural  usage  has arisen of ascribing to the sign whatever is true of that which the sign signifies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  sacraments  were  designed  to  represent,  seal,  and  apply  the benefits of Christ and the new covenant to believers. S. Cat., q. 92.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>They were designed to be pledges of our fidelity to Christ, binding us  to  his  service,  and  at  the  same  time  badges  of  our  profession, visibly marking the body of professors and distinguishing them from the world.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  first  section  of  this  chapter  says  that  a  sacrament  is  an ordinance "immediately instituted by God, to represent Christ," etc. This is true if the word " sacrament" is used in its general sense to include also the Old Testament sacraments of Circumcision and the Passover.  But  it  is  an  important  distinction  of  the  New  Testament sacraments  of  Baptism  and  the  Lord's  Supper  that  they  were  both immediately instituted by Christ himself. Therefore both the Larger (q. 162) and the Shorter (q. 92) Catechisms have it, "A sacrament is an holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his Church." This should be remembered,  because  it  serves  to  exclude  most  of  the  pretended sacraments of the Church of Rome from any right to a place in this class of Christian ordinances.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Every  sacrament  consists  of  two  elements  --  (1.)  An  outward, sensible sign; and (2.) an inward, spiritual grace, thereby signified.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In  Baptism the outward sensible sign is -- (1.) Water, and (2.) The water  applied  in  the  name  of  the  Triune  God  to  the  person  of  the subject baptized. The inward, spiritual grace, thereby signified is -(1.) Primarily, spiritual purification by the immediate personal power of  the  Holy  Ghost  in  the  soul;  and  hence,  (2.)  Secondarily,  the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, hence the union of the baptized with Christ, hence regeneration, justification, sanctification, perseverance to  the  end,  glorification,  etc.--  i.e.,  all  the  benefits  of  the  new covenant.  In  the  Lord's  Supper,  the  outward,  sensible  signs,  are  -(1.) Bread  and  wine;  and  (2.)  The  consecration,  and  the  bread broken,  and  the  wine  poured  out,  distributed  to,  and  received  and eaten and drunk by, the communicants. The inward, spiritual grace, thereby  signified  is  --  (1.)  Primarily,  Christ  crucified  (his  flesh  and blood shed) for us, and giving himself to us to be spiritually received and  assimilated  as  the  principle  of  a  new  life;  and  hence,  (2.) Secondarily, union with Christ, the indwelling of the Spirit, regeneration,  justification,  sanctification,  etc.--  i.e.,  all  the  benefits secured by the sacrificial death of Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>"There  is  in  every  sacrament  a  spiritual  relation  or  sacramental union  between  the  sign  and  the  thing  signified."  This  sacramental union between the sign and the grace which it signifies, the Romish and Lutheran Churches understand to be, at least in the case of the Lord's  Supper,  a  literal  identity.  Thus  when  Christ  took  the  bread and said, "This is my body," they insist that it means that the bread is his body. All other Christians understand the phrase to mean, " This bread represents sacramentally my body."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This  sacramental  union,  therefore,  between  the  sign  and  the  thing signified is (1.) Symbolical and representative -- the one symbolizes and so represents the other; and (2.) Instrumental, because by divine appointment, through the right use of the sign, the grace signified is really conveyed.</p>
<p>The grounds of this sacramental union are -- (1.) The natural fitness of the sign to symbolize the grace signified, as washing with water to symbolize spiritual purification by the Holy Ghost. (2.) The authoritative  appointment  of  Christ  that  these  signs,  rightly  used, shall  truly  represent  and  convey  the  grace  they  signify.  (3.)  The spiritual faith of the believing recipient, a gift of the Spirit of Christ, whereby, in the proper use of the sign, he is enabled to "discern the Lord's body." 1 Cor. xi. 29.</p>
<p>Out of this spiritual relation, or sacramental union between the sign and the grace signified, which we have thus explained by a natural and  legitimate  use  of  language,  the  one  is  put  for  the  other,  and whatever is true of the grace signified is asserted of the sign which signifies it. Thus, to eat the bread and drink the wine in the Lord's Supper is to eat the flesh  and  drink  the  blood  of  Christ;  that  is,  to participate in the sacrificial virtue of his death. And whatever is true at Baptism with the Holy Ghost is attributed to Baptism with water. Ananias  said  to  Paul,  "Arise,  and  be  baptized,  and  wash  away  thy sins." Acts xxii. 16. "Christ gave himself for the Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word." Eph. v.  26.  "Repent,  and  be  baptized,  every  one  of  you  in  the  name  of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Acts ii. 38. Hence Romanists and  Ritualists  have  inferred  that  the  sign  is  inseparable  from  the grace signified, and that these spiritual effects are due to the outward ordinance. Hence the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. But it must be observed that the Scriptures do not assert these spiritual attributes of water baptism in itself considered, but of water baptism as the sign or emblem of baptism by the holy Ghost. These spiritual attributes belong "only to baptism by the Spirit, and they accompany the sign only when the sign is accompanied by that which it signifies. It  does  not  follow,  however,  that  the  sign  is  inseparable  from  the grace.  The  grace  is  sovereign;  and  experience  teaches  us  that  it  is often  absent  from  the  sign,  and  that  the  sign  is  least  frequently honoured by the presence of the grace when it is itself most implicitly relied upon.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The sacraments were designed --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) To represent the benefits of Christ and the new covenant. They</li>
</ul>
<p>are  as  signs  or  pictures  of  the  truths  they  represent,  and  hence present those truths to the eyes and other senses of the recipients in a manner analogous to that in which they are presented to the ears in the  preaching  of  the  Word.  This  follows  from  what  has  just  been shown as to their beings outward, sensible signs, signifying inward and spiritual grace.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.)  They  were  designed  to  be  "seals"  of  the  benefits  of  the  new covenant.  The  gospel  is  presented  under  the  form  of  a  covenant. Salvation and all the benefits of Christ's redemption are offered upon the condition of faith. In the sacraments God sensibly and authoritatively  pledges  himself  to  invest  us  with  this  grace  if  we believe and obey. In receiving the sacrament we actively assume all the  obligations  implied  in  the  gospel,  and  bind  ourselves  to  fulfil them. " Circumcision," Paul says, is " the seal of the righteousness of faith," Rom. iv. 11; and Baptism is declared to be "the circumcision of Christ." Col. ii. 11, 12. We are said to be actually "buried with Christ by baptism" (Rom. vi.4); i.e., united to him in his death. Jesus says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke xxii. 20); that is, This  cup  represents  my  blood,  by  which  the  new  covenant  was ratified;  and  therefore  it  is  a  visible  confirmation  of  the  covenant, since  it  is a  visible  representative  of  the  blood.  If  a  man  was circumcised,  he  was  "a  debtor  to  do  the  whole  law."  Gal.  v.  3.  "As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." Gal. iii. 27.</li>
<li>(3.)  The  sacraments  were  designed  to  "apply  "--  i.e.,  actually  to convey -- to believers the benefits of the new covenant. If they are " seals"  of  the  covenant,  they  must  of  course,  as  a  legal  form  of investiture, actually convey the grace represented to those to whom it belongs. Thus a deed conveys an estate, or the key handed over in the presence of witnesses the possession of a house from the owner to the renter. Our Confession is explicit and emphatic on this subject. The old English word "exhibit," there used, does not mean to show forth;  but,  in  the  sense  of  the  Latin  exhibere,  from  which  it  is derived, to administer, to apply. Compare the following: "A</li>
</ul>
<p>sacrament  is  an  holy  ordinance  instituted  by  Christ;  wherein,  by sensible  signs,  Christ,  and  the  benefits  of  the  new  covenant,  are represented,  sealed,  and  applied  to  believers."  S.  Cat.,  q.  92.  "A sacrament is an holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his Church, to signify, seal, and exhibit unto those that are within the covenant of grace, the benefits of his mediation." L. Cat., q. 162. "The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments, rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them." Conf. Faith, ch. xxvii., section 3. "The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment  of time wherein it is administered; yet notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the  grace  promised  is  not  only  offered,  but  really  exhibited  and conferred by the Holy Ghost," etc. Conf. Faith, ch. xxviii., section 6. This  the  Confession  carefully  guards  in  the  third  section  of  this chapter,  showing  that  the  sacraments  have  no  inherent  power  or virtue  at  all,  but  that  the  right  use  of  the  sacrament  is  by  divine appointment the occasion upon which the Holy Ghost conveys the grace  to  those  to  whom  it  belongs.  So  that  this  grace-conferring virtue depends upon two things: (1.) The sovereign will and power of the Holy Spirit. (2.) The lively faith of the recipient. The sacrament is a mere  instrument;  but  IT  IS  AN  INSTRUMENT  OF  DIVINE APPOINTMENT.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  sacraments  being  seals  of  the  covenant  of  grace  --  at  once pledges  of  God's  faithfulness  to  us  and  of  our  obligation  to  him  -they of course (1.) Mark us as the divine property, and bind, us to the performance of our duty; and hence are (2.) Badges of our profession,  and,  putting  a  visible  difference  between  those  who belong to the Church and the rest of the world, give visibility to the Church, and separate its members from the world.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION III. The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither doth the efficacy  of  a  sacrament  depend  upon  the  piety  or  intention  of  him that doth  administer  it:[7]  but  upon  the  work  of  the  Spirit,[8]  and the  word  of  institution,  which  contains,  together  with  a  precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.

<p>Having asserted that the sacraments actually confer the grace which they  represent  to  worthy  recipients,  our  Confession  in  this  section proceeds  to  guard  this  important  truth  from  abuse,  by  carefully showing upon what this grace-conveying efficacy of the sacraments does not, and upon what it does depend.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This grace is not contained in the sacraments themselves, nor is it "conferred  by  any  power  in  them."  According  to  the  Romish  and Ritualistic  view,  the  grace  signified  is  contained  in  the  sacrament itself,  as  qualities  inhere  in  substances,  and  it  is  together  with  the outward sign presented in a real, objective sense, to every recipient, whether believer  or  unbeliever.  They  hold  also  that  the  sacrament confers this grace upon every recipient who does not positively resist, as an opus operatum the sole force of the sacramental action, as hot iron burns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole view is explicitly rejected as false by our Confession; and the whole efficacy of the sacrament is said to depend, not upon any part  of  it  separately,  nor  upon  the  whole  together,  but  upon  the sovereign power of the Holy Ghost, who is always present, and uses the sacrament as his instrument and medium.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  efficacy  of  the  sacraments  does  not  depend  upon  either  the personal  piety  or  the  "intention"  of  the  person  who  administers them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Romanists  admit  that  the  efficacy  of  the  sacraments  does  not depend upon the personal piety of the administrator; but they insist that  it depends  --  (1.)  Upon  the  fact  that  the  administrator  is canonically  authorized;  (2.)  Upon  the  fact  that  the  administrator exercises at the moment of administration the secret "intention" of doing  thereby  what  the  Church  intends  in  the  definition  of  the sacrament.  The  priest  may  outwardly  pronounce  every  word  and perform every action prescribed in the ritual, and the recipient may fulfil every condition required of him, and yet if the priest fails in the secret intention of conferring the grace through the sacrament then and there, the recipient goes away destitute of the grace he supposes himself  to have  received, and  which  the  priest  has  ostensibly professed to confer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>But  the  efficacy  of  the  sacraments  depends  --  (1.)  Upon  their divine appointment as means and channels of grace. They were not devised  by  man  as  suitable  in  themselves  to  produce  a  moral impression. But they were appointed by God, and we are commanded to use them as means of grace; and hence God virtually promises to meet every soul who uses them rightly in the sacrament. Christ  seals  his  gracious  covenant  by  them,  and  hence  in  their  use invests with the grace of that covenant every soul to which it belongs. (2.) The efficacy of the sacrament resides in the sovereign and everpresent personal agency of the Holy Ghost, who uses the sacraments as his instruments and media of operation. The Spirit is the executive of  God.  He  takes  of  the  things  of  Christ  and  shows  them  unto  us. Through him even the humanity of Jesus is virtually  omnipresent, and all the benefits secured by his sacrifice are revealed and applied.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION IV. There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord  in  the  Gospel;  that  is  to  say,  baptism,  and  the  Supper  of  the Lord: neither of which may be dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word lawfully ordained.[10]</p>
<ol>
<li>Matt. 28:19; I Cor. 4:1; 11:20, 23; Eph. 4:11-12</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have seen, the word "sacrament" was used very indefinitely in the  early  Church  to  include  any  religions  rite  which  had  a  latent spiritual meaning. A pre-eminence was always awarded to Baptism and  the  Lord's  Supper,  as  forming  a  class  by  themselves;  but  the number of  ordinances  to  which  the  term  "sacrament"  was  applied varied at different times and in different places from two to twelve. At last the number seven was suggested during the twelfth century, and determined authoritatively by the Council of Florence, 1439, and by the Council of Trent, 1562. These are Baptism, Confirmation, the Lord's  Supper,  Penance,  Extreme  Unction,  Orders,  Marriage.  In order to prove that "there be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the gospel -- that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord" --we  have  only to show  that the other five so-called sacraments  claimed  by  the  Romanists  do  not  belong  to  the  same class of ordinances with Baptism and the Lord's Supper; and we do this by applying the definition of a sacrament above given. Thus -Penance, Confirmation, and Extreme Unction are not divine institutions in any sense.</p>
<p>Marriage was instituted, not by Christ, but by God; and Orders were instituted by Christ: but neither of these ordinances (a.) consists of an  outward,  visible  sign,  signifying  an  inward,  spiritual  grace;  nor {b.)  does  either  of  them  "represent,  seal,  or  confer  Christ  and  the benefits of the new covenant."</p>
<p>Our Confession also adds that no one has a right to administer the sacraments save a lawfully ordained minister. This is not said in the interest  of  any  priestly  theory  of  the  ministry,  as  if  there  were  any grace or grace-conferring virtue transmitted by ordination in succession from the apostles to  the  person  ordained.  But  since  the Church  is  an  organized  society,  under  laws  executed  by  regularly appointed officers, it is evident that ordinances -- which are badges of  Church  membership,  the  gates  of  the  fold,  the  instruments  of discipline, and seals of the covenant formed by the great Head of the Church with his living members -- can properly be administered only by the highest legal officers of the Church, those who are commissioners as ambassadors for Christ to treat in his name with men. 1 Cor. iv. 1; 2 Cor. v. 20.</p>
<p>SECTION V. The sacraments of the old testament, in regard of the spiritual things thereby signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the new.[11]</p>
<ol>
<li>I Cor. 10:1-4; Rom. 4:11; Col. 2:11-12</li>
</ol>
<p>We saw, under chapter vii., sections 5 and 6, that the old and the new dispensations  were  only  two  different  modes  in  which  the  one changeless  covenant  of  grace  was  administered  and  its  blessings dispensed. The sacramental seals of the covenant must, therefore, be essentially the same then and now. The difference is -- (1.) That they were  more  prospective  and  typical  then,  and  that  they  are  more commemorative now. They signified a grace to be revealed then; they signify a grace already revealed now. (2,) They were, as to form, more gross and carnal then, and more spiritual now.</p>
<p>Thus  Baptism  has  taken  the  place  of  Circumcision  as  the  rite  of initiation. They both signify spiritual regeneration. Deut. x. 16; xxx. 6. Circumcision  was  Jewish  baptism,  and  Baptism  is  Christian circumcision. Gal. iii. 27, 29; Col. ii. 10 -- 12.</p>
<p>Thus the  Lord's  Supper  grew  out  of  the  Passover.  He  took  the  old bread and the old cup, and gave them a new consecration and a new meaning. Matt. xxvi. 26 -- 29. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us." 1 Cor. v. 7.</p>

<p>SECTION I. Baptism is a sacrament of the new testament, ordained by  Jesus  Christ,[1]  not  only  for  the  solemn  admission  of  the  party baptized into the visible church;[2] but also, to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace,[3] of his ingrafting into Christ,[4] of regeneration,[5] of remission of sins,[6] and of his giving up unto God,  through  Jesus  Christ,  to  walk  in  newness  of  life.[7]  Which sacrament  is,  by  Christ's  own  appointment,  to  be  continued  in  his church until the end of the world.[8]</p>

<li>Christian Baptism is an ordinance immediately instituted by Christ himself, and designed to be observed in the Church until the end of the  world.  Washing  the  body  with  water,  to  represent  spiritual purification and consecration, was a natural symbol which prevailed among  all  ancient  Eastern  nations  --  as  the  Persians,  Hindoos, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and pre-eminently among the Jews. Paul  summarily  describes  the  ancient  ceremonial  as  consisting  "in meats  and  drinks,  and  divers  baptisms."  Heb.  ix.  10.  John,  the forerunner of Jesus, came baptizing also. But this was not Christian Baptism, because -- (1.)  John  was  the  last  Old  Testament  prophet, and not a New Testament apostle (Luke i. 17); (2.) He did not baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; (3.) His baptism was unto repentance, not into the faith of Christ; (4.) He did not by baptism introduce men into the fellowship of the Christian Church, as the apostles did at Pentecost (Acts ii. 41, 47); (5.) Those baptized by John were baptized over again by the apostles when they were admitted to the Christian Church (Acts xviii. 24 -- 28; xix. 1 -5). For analogous reasons we believe that the baptism performed by his disciples previous to the crucifixion of the Lord (John iii. 22; iv. 1, 2) was not the permanent Christian sacrament of Baptism, binding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>its subjects  to  the  faith  and  obedience  of  the  Trinity,  and  initiating them into the Christian Church; but that, on the contrary, like  the baptism of John, it was a purifying rite, binding to repentance, and preparing the way for the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>It is certain that we have the true warrant of the Christian sacrament of Baptism from the lips of the great Head of the Church in person, in  Matthew xxviii. 18 -- 20: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them in  the  name  of  the  Father,  and  of  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen."</p>
<p>Some,  as  the  Quakers,  have  not  understood  that  this  command imposes the obligation of the perpetual observance of this ordinance. That the observance is to endure until the second coming of Christ is plain  --  (1.)  From  the  universal  maxim  that  every  law  continues binding until it is abrogated, or until the reason for it has ceased. But this  command  has  never  been  recalled,  and  the  reason  for  its observance  remains  precisely  what  it  was  when  the  command  was given. (2.) The plain terms of the command reach (a.) to all nations, and (b.) until the end of this world (aion). (3.) The example of the apostles. Acts ii. 38; xvi. 33. (4.) The constant practice of all branches of the Christian Church from the beginning to the present time.</p>

<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  the  action  which  constitutes  it,  Baptism  is  a  washing  with water (the manner of washing being indifferent) in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a lawfully ordained minister. The reason that Baptism should be administered only by a lawfully  ordained  minister  has  been  considered  under  the  last chapter.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Confession teaches that the command to baptize is a command to  wash  with  water  in  the  name  of  the  Trinity.  It  is  often,  but erroneously,  supposed  that  the  controversy  between  our  baptist brethren  and  the  rest  of  the  Christian  Church  with  respect  to Baptism  is  a  question  of  mode;  they  affirming  that  the  only  right mode is to immerse -- we affirming that the best mode is to sprinkle. This is a great mistake. The real Baptist position -- as stated by Dr. Alexander  Carson  (p.  55)  --  is,  that  the  command  to  baptize  is  a simple and single command to immerse, in order to symbolize the death, burial, and resurrection of the believer with Christ. The true position maintained by other Christians is, that Baptism is a simple and single command to wash with water, in order to symbolize the purification wrought by the Holy Ghost. Hence the mode of washing has  nothing  to  do  with  it.  It  is  necessarily  perfectly  indifferent,  so that it be decent. According to our view, the essential matter is the water,  and  the  application  of  the  water  in  the  name  of  the  Trinity. According  to  their  view,  the  essential  matter  is  the  burial,  total immersion, in water or sand, as the case may be. The evidence of the truth of the view entertained by the vast majority of Christ's Church is as follows: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) The word baptizo, in its classical usage, means to dip, to moisten, to  wet,  to  purify,  to  wash.  Dr.  Carson  admits  that  he  has  all  the lexicons against him.</li>
<li>(2.) In the Septuagint, Bapto and baptizo occur five times. Thus, Dan. iv. 33, Nebuchadnezzar is said to have been wet (baptized) with the dew of heaven. Ecclus. xxxiv. 30: "He that baptizeth himself after the touching of a dead body;" -- but this purification was performed by sprinkling. Num. xix. 9, 13, 20. See also 2 Kings v. 14, and Judith xii. 7.</li>
<li>(3.)  In  the  New  Testament,  baptizo  is  used  interchangeably  with nipto, which only means to wash. Compare Mark vii. 3, 4; Luke xi. 38; Matt. xv. 2, 20: and observe -- (a.) That to baptize is there used interchangeably  with  to wash.  (b.) The  washing  was  to  effect purification, for the unbaptized hands are called the unwashed and unclean  hands.  (c.)  The  common  mode  of  washing  hands  in  those countries is to pour water upon them. The rich have servants to pour</li>
</ul>
<p>the  water  on  their  hands;  the  poor  pour  the  water  on  their  own hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>(4.)  When  John's  disciples  disputed  about  baptism,  it  is  expressly said to have been a dispute about purification. John iii. 25; iv. 2.</li>
<li>(5.)  The  same idea is uniformly expressed by the word baptism, or baptisms,  in-the  New  Testament.  In  Mark  vii.  2-8  we  read  of  the baptisms  of  cups,  pots,  brazen  vessels,  and  tables  (couches  upon which several persons reclined at table). These things could not be, and  were  not,  immersed.  The  whole  object  of  the  service  was  not burial,  but  purification.  In  Heb.  ix.  10  Paul  says  that  the  first tabernacle  "stood  only  in  meats  and  drinks,  and  divers  baptisms;" and  below,  in  verses  13,  19,  21,  he  specifies  some  of  these  divers baptism--" For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer  sprinkling  the  unclean,  sanctifieth  to  the  purifying  of  the flesh;" -- and " Moses sprinkled both the book and all the people, and the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry."</li>
<li>(6.)  Baptism  with  water  is  emblematical  of  baptism  by  the  Holy Ghost, the object of which is spiritual purification. Matt. iii. 11; Mark i. 8; Luke iii. 16; John i. 26, 33; Acts i. 5; xi. 16. Spiritual baptism is called  "the  washing  of  regeneration,  and  renewing  of  the  Holy Ghost."  Tit.  iii.  5.  Baptism  with  water  symbolizes  baptism  by  the Holy Ghost. But baptism by the Holy Ghost unites us to Christ, and makes us one with him in his death, in his resurrection, in his new life  unto  God,  his  righteousness,  his  inheritance,  etc.,  etc.  Spiritual baptism carries all these consequences, and water baptism represents  spiritual  baptism;  therefore  we  are  said  to  be  baptized into Christ, into his death, into one body -- to be buried with him, to rise with him, so as to walk with him in newness of life -- to put on Christ (as a garment), to be planted together with him (as a tree), etc. None of these have anything to do with the mode of baptism because it is simply absurd to suppose that the same action can at the same time symbolize things so different as burial, putting on clothes, and planting  trees.  The  real  order  is:  washing  with  water  represents</li>
</ul>
<p>washing of the Spirit; washing of the Spirit unites  to  Christ;  union with Christ involves all the consequences above mentioned.</p>
<ul>
<li>(7.)  Baptism  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  of  which  water  baptism  is  the emblem, is never set forth in Scripture as an "immersion," but always as a " pouring" and " sprinkling." Acts ii. 1 -- 4, 32, 33; x. 44 -- 48; xi. 15,  16.  Of  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Ghost  it  is  said,  he  "  came  from heaven," was " poured out," " shed forth," " fell on them." Isa. xliv. 3: "  I  will  pour  my  Spirit  upon  thy  seed."  Isa.  lii.  15:  "  So  shall  he sprinkle many nations." Ezek. xxxvi. 25 -- 27: "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean," etc. Joel ii. 28, 29: " I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh."</li>
<li>(8.) The  universally prevalent manner  of  effecting the rite of purification among the Jews -- from the analogy of which Christian Baptism was taken -- was by sprinkling, and not by immersion. The hands and feet of the priests were to be washed at the brazen laver, from which water poured out through spouts or cocks. Ex. xxx. 18 -21; 2 Chron. iv. 6; 1 Kings vii. 27 -- 39. See also Lev. viii. 30; xiv. 7, 51; Ex. xxiv. 5 -- 8; Num. viii. 6, 7; Heb. ix. 12 -- 22.</li>
<li>(9.)  In  1  Cor.  x.  1,  2,  the  Israelites  are  said  to  have  been  "baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea." Compare Ex. xiv. 19 -- 31. But  the  Egyptians  who  were  immersed  were  not  baptized;  and  the Israelites who were baptized were not immersed. Dr. Carson (p. 413) says Moses got "a dry dip!" In 1 Pet. iii. 20, 21, it is said that Baptism is  the antitype of the salvation of the eight souls in the ark. Yet the very gist of their salvation consisted in their not being immersed.</li>
<li>(10.)  Among  all  the  recorded  instances  of  Baptism  performed  by John  the  Baptist  and  the  apostles,  there  is  not  one  in  which immersion is asserted, while there are many in which it was highly improbable  --  (a.)  Because  the  apostles  baptizing  and  the  early converts  baptized  were  all  Jews,  accustomed  to  purify  by  pouring and sprinkling. (b.) Because of the vast multitudes  baptized  at  one time, and the known scarcity of water in Jerusalem and generally in</li>
</ul>
<p>the situations spoken of. The eunuch was baptized on the roadside in a desert country. Acts viii. 26 -- 39. Three thousand were baptized in one day in the dry city of Jerusalem, which depends upon rain-water stored  in  tanks  and  cisterns.  Acts  ii.  37  --  41.  Vast  multitudes swarmed to John. Matt. iii. 5, 6. The jailer was baptized in prison at midnight Acts xvi. 25 -- 33. Paul was baptized by Ananias right at his bedside. Ananias said, " Standing up, be baptized;" and " standing up he  was  baptized."  Acts  ix.  18;  xxii.  16.  (c.)  The  earliest  pictorial representations of baptism, dating from the second or third century, all indicate that the manner of applying the water to the body of the baptized was by pouring. (d.) It is done in the same way universally by Eastern Christians at the present time.</p>
<p>That it is essential that this baptismal washing should be done in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is plain -(1.) From the explicit command to that effect expressed in the words of institution. Matt. xxviii. 18 -- 20. (2.) From the fact that Baptism, as a seal of the covenant of grace, and as the divinely appointed rite of initiation into the Christian Church, introduces the baptized into covenant  with,  and  the  public  profession  of,  the  true  God,  who  is none other than the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
<ol>
<li>The  design  of  Baptism  is  --  (1.)  To  signify,  seal,  and  confer,  to those to whom they belong, the benefits of Christ's redemption. Thus --  (a.)  It  signifies  or  symbolizes  the  "  washing  of  regeneration,  and renewing of the Holy Ghost," whereby we are united to Christ and made participants in all his redemptive grace. (b.) Christ herein seals the truth of his covenant, and thereby conveys to all the beneficiaries of that covenant the grace intended for them. The design of Baptism is, (2.) That it be a visible sign of our covenant to be the Lord's, and devoted to his service; and hence it is a public profession of our faith and badge of our allegiance, and hence of our formal initiation into the  Christian  Church,  and  a  symbol  of  our  union  with  our  fellow Christians. 1 Cor. xii. 13.</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION IV.  Not  only  those  that  do  actually  profess  faith  in  and obedience  unto  Christ,[11]  but  also  the  infants  of  one,  or  both, believing parents, are to be baptized.[12]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Acts 2:41; 8:12-13; 16:14-15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gen. 17:7-14; Gal. 3:9, 14; Col. 2:11-12; Acts 2:38-39; Rom. 4:11-</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>12; Matt. 19:13; 28:19; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17; I Cor. 7:14</p>
<p>As to the subjects of Baptism, our Standards teach -- l. As to adults: "Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out of the visible Church, and so strangers from the covenant of promise, till they profess their faith in Christ, and obedience to him." L. Cat., q. 166, and S. Cat., q. 95.</p>
<p>This  is of course  self-evident,  since  the  intelligent and  honest reception of Baptism itself obviously involves precisely this profession of faith in Christ and obedience to him. And in order to secure this,  the  usage  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  requires  that  the pastors and church session should inform the applicant that only a person who has experienced the grace of regeneration, and who has consequently truly repented of sin and exercised faith in Christ, can honestly  do  what  all  necessarily  profess  to  do  when  they  are baptized. And to this end the pastor and session must require of the applicant the evidence (1.) Of a competent  knowledge  of  the fundamental truths  of  Christianity,  and  of  the  nature  and  binding obligation  of  Baptism;  (2.)  Of  the  fact  that  he  makes  a  consistent profession of a personal experimental faith and promise of obedience to  the  Lord,  and  of  due  subjection  to  the  constituted  authorities  of the Church; (3.) Of the fact that his outward walk and conversation do not belie his profession. After this, the entire responsibility of the step must lie upon the person talking it. The church officers have no authority  to  sit  in  judgment  upon  the  genuineness  of  his  Christian character,  because  God  has  given  to  no  class  of  men  the  ability  to judge  aright  of  such  matters.  Some  Churches,  as,  for  instance,  our Covenanting Presbyterian brethren, demand, as a condition of adult baptism -- or, what is the same thing, admission to the Church -- in addition to the profession of faith in the fundamental truths of the Gospel, adherence to certain "Testimonies" embodying nonfundamental,  denominational  peculiarities.  This  we  believe  to  be entirely  unauthorized.  The  Church  is  Christ's  fold,  designed  for  all his sheep. Baptism and the Lord's Supper are the common rights of all  the  Lord's  people.  If  any  man  holds  the  fundamentals  of  the gospel  and  professes  allegiance  to  our  common  Lord,  and  acts consistently  therewith,  we  have  no  right  to  exclude  him  from  his Father's house. It is just as presumptuous  to  make  terms  of communion which Christ has not made as it would be to make terms of salvation which he does not require.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  infants,  our  Standards teach that an infant, one or both of whose parents are believers (Conf. Faith, ch. xxviii. section  4)  --  -i.e., one  or  both  of  whose  parents  profess  faith  in  Christ  and obedience to him (L. Cat., q. 166) -- is to be baptized. A bare outline of  the  abundant  Scriptural  evidence  of  this  truth  may  be  stated  as follows: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) In constituting human nature and ordaining the propagation of infant  children  from  parents,  God  has  in  all  respects  made  the standing  of  the  child  while  an  infant  to  depend  upon  that  of  the parent. The sin of the parent carries away the infant from God; so the faith of the parent brings the infant near to God.</li>
<li>(2.) Every covenant God has ever formed with mankind has included the child with the parent; -- e.g., the covenants formed with Adam; with Noah, Gen. ix. 9 -- 17; with Abraham, Gen. xii. 1 -- 3; xvii. 7; with Israel through Moses, Ex. xx. 5; and again, Deut. xxix. 10 -- 13; and in the opening sermon of the New Testament dispensation men are exhorted to repent and believe, " because the promise (covenant) is unto you and to your children," etc. Acts ii. 38, 39.</li>
<li>(3.)  The  Old  Testament  Church  is  the  same  as  the  New  Testament Christian Church. (a.) Paul says (Gal. iii. 8) that the covenant made with Abraham (Gen. xvii. 7) is the "gospel;" and in the whole epistle</li>
</ul>
<p>to the Hebrews he shows that the Old Testament ritual was a setting forth of the person and work of Christ. See above, under chapter vii. (b.)  Faith  was  the  condition  of  salvation  then  as  well  as  now.  " Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness" (Rom. iv. 3); so that he was the great typical believer, "the father of all them that believe" (Rom. iv. 11); and all who believe in Christ "are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. iii. 29. See also  the  eleventh  chapter  of  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  All  the Israelites,  even  those  only  "according  to  the  flesh,"  professed  to believe. And all "true" Israelites did believe. "He is not a Jew, which is  one  outwardly;  neither  is  that  circumcision,  which  is  outward  in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter." Rom. ii. 28, 29. (c.) Circumcision, precisely in the same sense and to the same extent as  Baptism,  represented  a  spiritual  grace  and  bound  to  a  spiritual profession. This is taught in the 0ld Testament, as witness Deut. x. 16; xxx. 6. It was the seal of the Abrahamic covenant, which Paul says is the gospel. Gen. xii. 3; xvii. 7, 10; Gal. iii. 8. It was the seal of the righteousness  of  faith.  Rom.  ii.  28,  29;  iv.  11.  True  Circumcision unites to Christ and secures all the benefits of his redemption. Col. ii. 10, 11. And Baptism has now taken the precise place of Circumcision: " For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ......And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according  to  the  promise."  Gal.  iii.  27,  29.  (d.)  This  Church  is identically the same with the New Testament Church. It has the same foundation; the same condition of membership, faith and obedience; sacraments of the same spiritual significancy and binding force, The ancient  prophecies  declare  that  the  same  old  Church  is  to  be enlarged,  not  changed.  Isa.  xlix.  13  --  23;  1x.  1  --  14.  The  ancient covenant,  which was the fundamental charter of the Church, included  "many nations"  (Gen.  xvii.  4;  Rom.  iv.  17,  18;  Gal.  iii.  8), which was never fulfilled until after the expansion of the Church in the  New  Testament  dispensation.  And  Paul  says  that  the  Jewish Church,  instead  of  being  abrogated,  remains  the  same  through  all change  --  the  Jewish  branches  being  cut  off,  the  Gentile  branches being grafted in; and that hereafter the Jews are to be restored, not to a new Church, but "into their own olive tree." Rom, xi. 18 -- 24. See also Eph. ii. 11 -- 22.</p>
<p>(4.)  Infants were members of the Church under the Old Testament from  the  beginning,  being  circumcised  upon  the  faith  of  their parents. Now, as the Church is the same Church; as the conditions of membership were the same then as now; as Circumcision signified and bound to precisely what Baptism does; and since Baptism has taken precisely the place of Circumcision -- it follows that the church membership of the children of professors should be recognized now as  it  was  then,  and  that  they  should  be  baptized.  The  only  ground upon which this conclusion could be obviated would be that Christ in the gospel explicitly turns them out of their ancient birth-right in the Church.</p>
<p>(5.)  On  the  contrary,  Christ  and  his  apostles  uniformly,  without exception, speak of and treat children on the assumption that they remain  in  the  same  church  relation  they  have  always  occupied. Christ,  speaking  to  Jewish  apostles,  who  had  all  their  lives  never heard of any other than the old Padobaptist Church, into which they had been themselves born and circumcised (and their infant circumcision  was  the  only  baptism  they  ever  received),  never  once warns them that he had changed this relation. On the contrary, he says, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven" (i.e., new dispensation  of the old Church). Matt. xix. 14; Luke xviii. 16. He commissioned Peter to feed the lambs as well as the sheep of the flock (John xxi, 15-17); and all  the  apostles  to  "disciple  all  nations,"  by  first  baptizing  and then teaching them. Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. If only one of the parents is a Christian, the children are said to be "holy," or "saints;" which is a common designation  of  church  members  in  the  New  Testament.  1 Cor.  vii.  14.  In  the  old  Jewish  Church  every  proselyte  from  the heathen  brought  his  children  into  the  Church  with  him.  So  the Jewish  apostles  write  the  brief  history  of  their  missionary  labours precisely as all modern Padobaptist missionaries write theirs, and as no Baptist missionary  ever wrote  from  the first rise of their denomination.  There  are  only  eleven  cases  of  Baptism  recorded  in the Acts and the Epistles. In the case of two of these, Paul and the Ethiopian eunuch, there were no children to be baptized. Five of the cases  were  large  crowds.  After  Stephanas  was  baptized  with  the crowd among "the many Corinthians," Paul baptized his household. Also  were  the  households  of  Lydia,  of  the  jailer,  of  Crispus,  and probably  of  Cornelius,  baptized.  Thus  in  every  case  in  which  the household  existed  it  was  baptized.  The  faith  of  the  head  of  the household is mentioned, but not that of the household itself, except in  one  case,  and  that  as  a  general  fact.  The  apostles  also  address children as members of the Church. Compare Eph. i. 1 with Eph. vi. 1 -- 3, and Col. i. 1, 2 with Col. iii. 20.</p>
<p>(6.) This has been the belief and practice of a vast majority of God's people from the first. The early Church, in unbroken continuity from the days of the apostles, testify to their custom on this subject. The Greek  and  the  Roman,  and  all  branches  of  the  Lutheran  and  the Reformed  Churches,  agree  in  this  fundamental  point.  The  Baptist denomination,  which  opposes  the  whole  Christian  world  in  this matter,  is  a  very  modern  party,  dating  from  the  Anabaptists  of Germany, A.D. 1687.</p>
<p>Our Standards teach that precisely the same requirements are made the condition on the part of the parent of having his child baptized that are made the condition of approach to the Lord's table. S. Cat. q. 95: "Infants of such as are members of the visible Church are to be baptized." This is explained, L. Cat., q. 166: "Infants descending from parents, either both, or but one of them, professing faith in Christ;" and  Conf.  Faith,  ch.  xxviii.,  section  4:  "  Infants  of  one  or  both believing parents." In the [American] Directory for Worship, ch. vii., the minister is to require of the parents, among other things, "that they pray with and for (the child); that they set an example of piety and  godliness  before  it;  and  endeavour  by  all  means  of  God's appointment to bring up their child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." The [American] General Assembly in 1794, in answer to an  overture  on  the  subject,  declared  that  the  above  passage  in  the</p>
<p>Directory  is  to  be  understood  as  bringing  the  parent  under  an express engagement to do as there required by the minister.</p>
<p>Some  have  supposed,  since  the  church-membership  of  the  child follows from that of the parent, that every person who was himself introduced into the Church by Baptism in infancy has an indefeasible right  to  have  his  children  baptized,  whether  he  professes  personal faith in Christ or not. But this is manifestly absurd -- (a.) Because all members of the Church have not a right to all privileges of churchmembership. Thus baptized members have no right to come to the communion until they make a profession of personal faith. Until they do  this  they  are  like  citizens  under  age,  with  their  rights  held  in suspension, as a just punishment for their refusal to believe. These suspended rights are those of communing and having their children baptized. (b.) A person destitute of personal faith can only commit perjury and sacrilege by making the solemn professions and talking the obligations involved in the baptismal covenant. It is a sin for him to do it, and a sin for the minister to help him to do it.</p>
<p>V.  Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance, [13] yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as  that  no  person  can  be  regenerated,  or  saved,  without  it;[14]  or, that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.[15]</p>

<p>VI.  The  efficacy  of  baptism  is  not  tied  to  that  moment  of  time wherein it is administered;[16] yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time.[17]</p>

<p>VII. The sacrament of baptism is but once to be administered unto any person.[18]</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Rom. 6:3-11</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections teach: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That grace and salvation are not so inseparably united to Baptism that only the baptized are saved, or that all the baptized are saved.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That,  nevertheless,  it  is  a  great  sin  to  contemn  or  neglect  this ordinance; for its observance is commanded and, in the right use of it,  the  grace  promised  is  not  only  offered,  but  really  exhibited  and conferred by the Holy Ghost to such (whether of age or infants) as the grace belongeth unto.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  efficacy  of  Baptism,  even  in  cases  in  which  the  grace signified is really conveyed, is not tied down to the moment of time wherein  the  sacrament  is  administered,  but  is  conveyed  to  the recipient according to the counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The sacrament of Baptism is to be administered but once to any person.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The  ground  taken here is intermediate between  two  opposite extremes --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.) The  extreme held by Papists and Ritualists of baptismal regeneration. (a.) This is not taught in Scripture. The language relied upon to prove it (John iii. 5; Acts ii. 38) is easily explained on the principle  that,  in  virtue  of  the  sacramental  union  between  the  sign and  the  grace  signified,  what  is  true  of  the  one  is  metaphorically predicated  of  the  other.  There  is  nothing  said  of  the  efficacy  of Baptism which is not likewise said of the efficacy of the truth. James</li>
<li>i. 18; John xvii. 19; Pet. i. 28. But the mere hearing of the truth saves no  one.  (b.)  Baptism  cannot  be  the  only  or  ordinary  means  of regeneration, because faith and repentance are the fruits of regeneration, but the prerequisites of Baptism. Acts ii. 38; viii. 37; x. 47. (c.) Universal experience in Romanist and Ritualistic communities proves that the baptized are not generally regenerated. Our Saviour says, " By their fruits ye shall know them." Matt. vii. 20. (2.) Our Standards oppose the other extreme, that Baptism is a mere sign of grace and badge of Christian profession. Their doctrine is --</li>
<li>(a.) That Baptism does not only signify, but really and truly seal and convey, grace to those to whom it belongs according to the covenant - that is, to the elect.</li>
<li>(b.) But that this actual conveyance of the grace sealed is not tied to the  moment  in  which  the  sacrament  is  administered,  but  is  made according  to  the  precise  provisions  as  to  time  and  circumstance predetermined in the eternal covenant of grace. So property may be sealed  and  conveyed  in  a  deed  to  a  minor,  but  the  minor  may  not actually  enter  into  the  fruition  of  it  until  such  time  and  upon  such conditions as are predetermined in his father's will.</li>
<li>(c.)  The  efficacy  of  the  sacrament  is  not  due  to  any  spiritual  or magical quality communicated to the water.</li>
<li>(d.)  But  this  efficacy  does  result  (1.)  From  the  moral  power  of  the truth which the rite symbolizes. (2.) From the fact that it is a seal of the  covenant  of  grace,  and  a  legal  form  of  investing  those  persons embraced  in  the  covenant  with  the  graces  promised  therein.  (3.) From the  personal  presence  and  sovereignly  gracious  operation  of the  Holy  Spirit,  who  uses  the  sacrament  as  his  instrument  and medium.</li>
<li>(e.) That through  these channels the grace signified is really conveyed to the persons to whom, according to the divine counsel, it truly belongs; yet this grace and the influences of the Holy Ghost are</li>
</ul>
<p>not so tied to the sacrament that they are never, or even infrequently, conveyed  in any other way. The  very grace conveyed  by  the sacrament  must  be  possessed  by  the  adult  as  a  prerequisite  to Baptism,  and  is often subsequently  experienced  through  other channels.</p>
<ul>
<li>(f.) Hence the necessity for being baptized arises (1.) From the divine command. Obedience is of course necessary where there is knowledge. (2.) It is the proper and only efficient method of making a  profession  of  faith  and  allegiance  to  Christ.  (3.)  It  is  eminently helpful as a means of grace.</li>
</ul>
<p>That  Baptism  is  never  to  be  administered  more  than  once  to  any person  appears  (1.)  From  the  symbolical  significance  of  the  rite.  It signifies spiritual regeneration -- the inauguration of the divine life. Of  course  it  can  have  but  one  commencement.  (2.)  It  is  the  rite  of initiation  into  the  Christian  Church,  and  as  there  is  no  provision made  for  getting  out  of  the  Church  when  once  in,  so  there  is  no provision  made  for  coming  in  more  than  once.  (3.)  The  apostles baptized each individual but once.</p>

<p>SECTION: I Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, instituted  the  sacrament  of  his  body  and  blood,  called  the  Lord's Supper, to be observed in his church, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of himself in his death; the  sealing  all  benefits  thereof  unto  true  believers,  their  spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him; and, to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other, as members of his mystical body.[1]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>I Cor. 10:16-17, 21; 11:23-26; 12:13</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THIS section teaches us -- 1. Of the time in which, and the person by whom,  the Lord's Supper was instituted. 2. Of its perpetual obligation. 3. Of its design and effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Of the fact that it was instituted by our Lord in person on the night in which he was betrayed there can be no doubt. The fact is explicitly declared by three of the evangelists (Matt. xxvi. 26 -- 29; Mark xiv. 22 -- 25; Luke xxii. 19, 20) and by Paul (1 Cor. xi. 23 -- 25); and it remains to this day a monument of the truth of the Gospel history with which it is associated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That it was designed to be observed perpetually to the end of the world is evident -- (1.) From the words of the institution, "This do in remembrance of me," Luke xxii. 19; and again, "This do ye, as oft as</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ye drink it, in remembrance of me." 1 Cor. xi. 25. (2.) The apostolic example. Acts ii. 42. (3.) The frequent references to this  ordinance which occur in the apostolic writings, and which all imply that it is of perpetual obligation. (4.) The uniform and universal practice of the Christian Church, in all its branches, from the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As  to  the  design  of  the  Lord's  Supper,  the  teaching  of  our Standards may be exhibited under the following heads: --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.)  The  Lord's  Supper  is  a  commemoration  of  the  death  of  Christ. This is evident -- (a.) From the fact that the bread is an emblem of his body broken, and the wine of his blood shed upon the cross for us. Matt. xxvi. 26 -- 28; Luke xxii. 19, 20. (b.) From the fact that the act of eating the bread and of drinking the wine is declared, both by Christ and by Paul, to be done "in remembrance" of Christ, and to "shew his death till he come." Luke xxii. 19; 1 Cor. xi. 26.</li>
<li>(2.) It is a seal of the gospel covenant wherein all the benefits of the new  covenant  are  signified,  sealed,  and  applied  to  believers.  Conf. Faith, ch. xxix., section 1; L. Cat., q. 162; S. Cat. q. 92. Christ says, "This cup is the new testament (covenant) in my blood, which is shed for you" (Luke xxii. 20); i.e., My blood is the seal of the covenant of grace, and this cup is the symbol of my blood, and as such is offered to  you.  In  its  use  Christ  ratifies  his  promise  to  save  us  on  the condition  of  faith,  and  to  endow  us  with  all  the  benefits  of  his redemption.  We,  in  taking  this  pledge,  solemnly  bind  ourselves  to entire self-consecration and to all that is involved in the requirements of the gospel of Christ, not as we understand them, but as he intends them. It is a universal principle that all oaths bind in the sense in which they are understood by the persons who impose them.</li>
<li>(3.) Hence it is a badge of Christian profession -- a mark of allegiance of a citizen of the kingdom of heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p>(4.) It was designed to signify and effect our communion with Christ, in his person, in his offices, and in their precious fruits. Paul says (1 Cor.  x.  16),  "The  cup  of  blessing  which  we  bless,  is  it  not  the communion (koinonia) of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break,  is  it  not  the  communion  of  the  blood  of  Christ?"  L.  Cat.,  q. 170:  "  So  they  that  worthily  communicate  in  the  sacrament  of  the Lord's Supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and  really,  while  by  faith  they  receive  and  apply  unto  themselves Christ  crucified,  and  all  the  benefits  of  his  Death."  The  bread represents his flesh, and the wine represents his blood. We receive the symbol with the mouth corporally; we receive the flesh and blood symbolized by faith, yet really. "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life......For my flesh is meat indeed, and nay blood is drink indeed." John vi. 54, 55.</p>
<ul>
<li>(5.) It was  designed  to show  forth and  to effect the mutual communion of believers  with  each  other,  as  members  of  one  body and of one blood. 1 Cor. x. 17: " For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread." Union with the common Head necessarily implies communion with each other in that Head.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION:II In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to his Father; nor any real sacrifice made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead;[2]  but  only  a  commemoration  of  that  one  offering  up  of himself,  by  himself,  upon  the  cross,  once  for  all:  and  a  spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God, for the same:[3] so that the popish  sacrifice  of  the  mass  (as  they  call  it)  is  most  abominably injurious to Christ's one, only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of his elect.[4]</p>

<p>SECTION: III The Lord Jesus hath, in this ordinance, appointed his ministers  to  declare  his  word  of  institution  to  the  people;  to  pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart  from  a  common  to  an  holy  use;  and  to  take  and  break  the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give  both  to  the  communicants;[5]  but  to  none  who  are  not  then present in the congregation.[6]</p>

</ol>
<p>SECTION: IV Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any other, alone;[7] as likewise, the denial of the cup to the people, [8]  worshiping  the  elements,  the  lifting  them  up,  or  carrying  them about,  for  adoration,  and  the  reserving  them  for  any  pretended religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.[9]</p>

<p>SECTION: V The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name  of  the  things  they  represent,  to  wit,  the  body  and  blood  of Christ;[10]  albeit,  in  substance  and  nature,  they  still  remain  truly and only bread and wine, as they were before.

</li>
<li>
<p>I Cor. 11:26-28; Matt. 26:29</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION:  VI  That  doctrine  which  maintains  a  change  of  the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood  (commonly  called  transubstantiation)  by  consecration  of  a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense, and reason; overthroweth the nature of the sacrament, and hath been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yea, of gross idolatries.[12]</p>
<ol>
<li>Acts 3:21; I Cor. 11:24-26; Luke 24:6, 39</li>
</ol>
<p>The form in which the statements made in these sections are put is rather  negative  than  positive  --  rather  designed  to  oppose  certain Romish and Ritualistic errors than to make a simple statement of the true doctrine of the sacrament. The errors which are here opposed are  --  (1.)  The  doctrine  of  transubstantiation,  or  the  change  of  the entire  substance  of  the  bread  and  wine  into  the  body,  blood,  soul, and divinity of the Lord Jesus. (2.) The sacrifice of the mass. (3.) The worshipping  and  reservation  of  the  elements  for  any  pretended religious use. (4.) Denying the cup to the laity. (5.) Private communion  of  the  priest  alone,  or  the  sending  of  the  elements  to persons not present at the administration of the ordinance.</p>
<p>In order to make the statements of these sections plain, we will first state  the  true  doctrine  --  (1.)  As  to  what  elements  and  actions  are essential to the sacrament, and (2.) As to the true relation between the sign and the grace signified; and, secondly, present the opposing Papal errors upon the points above stated.</p>
<ol>
<li>The true doctrine (1.) As to the elements. These are -- (a.) Bread. This is essential, because it is in the command; and because bread, as the  staff  of  life  for  the  body,  is  the  proper  symbol  of  that  spiritual food  that  nourishes  the  soul.  Christ  instituted  the  Supper  at  the passover,  when  the  only  bread  at  hand  was  unleavened.  The  early Church always used the common bread of daily life. The Romish and Lutheran Churches hold that unleavened bread should be used: the Reformed  Churches  have  uniformly  held  that  the  bread  intended, and  that  best  fulfils  the  conditions  of  the  symbol,  is  the  common bread of daily life -- not the sweet cake used in so many of our old churches. (b.) Wine; that is oinos, the fermented juice of the grape. Matt. ix. 17; John ii. 3-- 10; Rom. xiv. 21; Eph. v. 18; 1 Tim. iii. 8; v.</li>
</ol>
<p>23; Titus ii. 3. This is made essential by the command and example of Christ, and by the uniform custom of the Christian Church from the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>(2.) As  to the  sacramental  actions  which  are  essential  to  this ordinance. (a.) The consecration. This includes the repetition of the words  of  Christ  used  in  the  institution,  together  with  a  prayer  in which the divine blessing is invoked upon the worshippers in the use of the ordinance, and so much of the elements as shall be used in the sacrament set apart from a common to a sacred use. (See section iii. of  this  chapter.)  The  words  which  express  this  in  the  Scripture  are eucharisteo Luke xxii. 19; and eulogeo, Matt. xxvi. 26, and 1 Cor. x. 16. (b.) The breaking of the bread. This is symbolical of the rending of  Christ's  body  on  the  cross,  and  of  all  the  communicants,  being many, feeding upon one Christ, as upon one bread. It is particularly mentioned in every account given of the institution by the evangelists. Matt. xxvi. 26; Mark xiv. 22; Luke xxii. 19; 1 Cor. xi. 24. See 1 Cor. x. 16. In Acts ii. 42 the whole ordinance is designated from this  constituent  action.  (c.)  The  distribution  and  reception  of  the elements.  This  is  an  essential  part  of  the  ordinance,  which  is  not completed  when  the  minister  consecrates  the  elements,  nor  until they are actually received and eaten and drunk by the people. Christ says, "This do in remembrance of me." Paul adds, "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come."  Luke  xxii.  19;  1  Cor.  xi.  26.  So  that  the  essence  of  the sacrament consists in the eating and the drinking.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Papal  errors  condemned  in  these  sections  are  --  (1.)  Their doctrine  of  transubstantiation,  or  conversion  of  substance.  The Council  of  Trent  teaches  (sess.  xiii. cans. 1-4) that the whole substance of the bread is changed into the literal body, and the whole substance of the wine is changed into the literal blood, of Christ; so that only the appearance or sensible properties of the bread and wine remain, and the only substances present are the true body and blood, soul and divinity, of our Lord. And thus he is objectively presented to, and  is eaten and  drunk  by, every recipient, believer and</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>unbeliever  indifferently;  and  thus  he  remains  before  and  after  the communion, his very body and blood, Godhead and manhood, shut up in a vessel, carried about, elevated, worshipped, etc.</p>
<p>The  Lutherans  hold  that  while  the  bread  and  the  wine  remain, nevertheless at the words of consecration the real body and blood of Christ,  though  invisible,  are  really  present  in,  with,  and  under  the bread and wine.</p>
<p>The only ground of this doctrine is the word of our Lord, "This is my body." They hold the word "is" is literal: all the Reformed churches hold  it  must  mean  "represents,"  "  symbolizes."  This  is  a  frequent usage  of  the  word  in  Scripture.  "  The  seven  good  kine  are  seven years;  and  the  seven  good  ears  are  seven  years."  Gen.  xli.  26,  27; Ezek. xxxvii. 11; Dan. vii. 24; Luke xii. 1; Rev. i. 20. Besides, when our Lord said this, and gave them the bread to eat, he was sitting by them in his sound, undivided flesh, eating and drinking with them.</p>
<p>This doctrine, then, is false (a.) Because it is not taught in Scripture. (A.)  Because  it  confounds  the  very  idea  of  sacrament,  making  the sign identical with the thing it signifies. (c.) It contradicts our senses, since  we  see,  smell,  taste,  and  feel  bread  and  wine,  and  do  never either  see, or smell, or taste, or feel flesh and  blood.  (d.) It contradicts  reason;  for  reason  teaches  that  qualities  cannot  exist except as they inhere in some substance, and that substance cannot be  known  and  cannot  act  except  by  its  qualities.  But  this  doctrine supposes  that  the  qualities  of  bread  and  wine  remain  without  any substance, and that the substance of flesh and blood remains without any  qualities.  (e.)  It  is  absurd  and  impossible;  because  Christ's glorified body is still material and therefore finite, and therefore not omnipresent in all places on earth, but absent at the right hand of God in heaven.</p>
<p>(2.) Their doctrine as to the mass as a sacrifice. The Council of Trent teaches  (sess.  xxii., cans.  1  -3) that  the  Eucharist  is  both  a sacrament and a sacrifice. As a sacrament, the soul of the recipient is nourished by the real body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ, which he  eats  in  the  form  of  a  wafer.  As  a  sacrifice,  it  is  "an  external oblation of the body  and  blood  of Christ offered to God,  in recognition of his supreme lordship, under the appearance of bread and wine visibly exhibited by a legitimate minister, with the addition of certain prayers and ceremonies prescribed by the Church, for the greater worship of God and edification of the people." This is not a mere act in commemoration of the one sacrifice upon the cross, but a constantly  repeated  real,  although  bloodless,  expiatory  sacrifice, atoning for sin and propitiating God. (Counc. Trent, sess. xxii., can. 3.)</p>
<p>This  doctrine  is  false,  because  --  (a.)  It is nowhere  taught  in Scripture. (b.) The Christian ministry are never called or spoken of as priests,  but  as  "  teachers"  and  "  rulers."  (c.)  The  one  sacrifice  of Christ on the cross was perfect, and excludes all others. Heb. ix. 25 -28; x. 10 -- 27. (d.) The same ordinance cannot be both a sacrament and  a  sacrifice.  Christ  says  that  by  eating  and  drinking  we  are  to "shew forth his death," and to "do this in remembrance of him." The same act cannot be a commemoration of one sacrifice, and itself an actual sacrifice having intrinsic sin-expiating efficacy.</p>
<ul>
<li>(3.) Since the Papists hold that the entire substance of the bread and wine is permanently changed into the body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ, they consequently maintain that the principal intention of the  ordinance  is  accomplished  when  the  words  of  consecration  are pronounced and the change effected. Hence they preserve the host carefully shut up in the pyx, elevate and adore and carry it about in their processions.  All  this  stands  or  falls with  the  doctrine  of transubstantiation, before refuted.</li>
<li>(4.)  After  the  establishment  of  the  doctrine  of  transubstantiation, there  arose  the  natural  fear  lest  some  of  the  august  person  of  the Lord should be spoiled or lost from the crumbling of the bread or the spilling  of  the  wine.  Hence  the  bread  is  prepared  in  little  wafers which  cannot  crumble,  and  the  cup  is  denied  to  the  laity  and</li>
</ul>
<p>confined to the priests. To comfort the laity, they teach that as the blood is in the flesh, and as the soul is in the body, and as the divinity is  in  the  soul  of  Christ,  the  whole  person  --  body,  blood,  soul  and divinity -- of Christ is equally in every particle of the bread; so that he who receives the bread receives all. (Counc. Trent, sess. xxi., cans. 1 - 3.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(5.)  In  opposition  to  the  manifold  abuses  of  this  ordinance  which prevail  among  the  Romanists,  our  Standards,  in  common  with  the general  judgment  of  the  Reformed  Churches,  teach  that  the  Lord's Supper is  essentially  a  communion,  in  which  the  fellowship  of  the believer with Christ and with his fellow-believers is set forth by their eating and drinking of the same bread and the same cup. It follows that it should not be sent to persons not present at the administration, nor administered by the officiating priest to himself alone. In particular cases, however, it may be administered in private houses,  for  the  benefit  of  Christians  long  confined  by  sickness, provided that the officers and a sufficient number of the members of the Church be present to preserve the true character of the ordinance as a communion.</li>

<p>SECTION: VII Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements,  in  this  sacrament,[13]  do  then  also,  inwardly  by  faith, really  and  indeed,  yet  not  carnally  and  corporally  but  spiritually, receive, and feed upon, Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present  to  the  faith  of  believers  in  that  ordinance,  as  the  elements themselves are to their outward senses.[14]</p>

<p>SECTION:  VIII  Although  ignorant  and  wicked  men  receive  the outward elements in this sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified  thereby;  but,  by  their  unworthy  coming  thereunto,  are guilty  of  the  body  and  blood  of  the  Lord,  to  their  own  damnation. Wherefore,  all  ignorant  and  ungodly  persons,  as  they  are  unfit  to enjoy communion with him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,[15] or be admitted thereunto.[16]</p>

<p>I Cor. 5:6-7, 13; II Thess. 3:6, 14-15; Matt. 7:6</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These sections teach the Reformed doctrine as to the relation which in the  Lord's  Supper  subsists  between  the  sign  and  the  grace signified;  that  is,  as  to  the  nature  of  the  presence  of  Christ  in  the sacrament,  and the sense in which, consequently, the worthy recipient is said to feed upon the body and blood of the Lord. This Reformed doctrine may be stated as follows: --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  bread  and  wine  --  always  remaining  mere  bread  and  wine, without  change  --  represent,  by  the  divine  appointment,  the  flesh and blood of the Redeemer offered as a sacrifice for sin. The relation between the bread and wine and the body and blood is purely moral or representative.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The body and blood are present, therefore, only virtually; that is, the virtues and effects of the sacrifice of the body of the Redeemer on the cross are made  present  and  are  actually  conveyed  in  the sacrament  to  the  worthy  receiver  by  the  power  of  the  Holy  Ghost, who uses the sacrament as his instrument according to his sovereign will.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>When it is said, therefore, that believers receive and feed upon the body and blood of Christ,  it  is  meant  that  they  receive,  not  by  the mouth, but through faith, the benefits secured by Christ's sacrificial death  upon  the  cross  --  that  this  feeding  upon  Christ  is  purely spiritual, accomplished through the free and sovereign agency of the Holy Ghost and through the instrumentality and in the exercise of faith alone; so that in no case is it ever done by the unbeliever. The</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>unbeliever,  therefore,  receiving  the  outward  sign  with  his  mouth while he fails to receive the inward grace in his soul, only increases his  own  condemnation and hardens his own heart by the exercise. All, therefore, who are known to be unbelievers, and whose unbelief is  made  manifest  either  by  their  ignorance  or  their  ungodliness, should be prevented, both for their  own  sake  and  for  the  Church's sake, from coming to the Lord's table until they are able to make a credible profession of their faith.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Hence, also, it follows that believers do, in the same sense, receive and feed upon the body and blood of Christ at other times without the use of the sacrament, and in the use of other means of grace -- as prayer, meditation on the Word, etc.</li>

<p>SECTION: I The Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his church, hath therein  appointed  a  government,  in  the  hand  of  church  officers, distinct from the civil magistrate.[1]</p>
<ol>
<li>Isa. 9:6-7; Col. 1:18; I Tim. 5:17; I Thess. 5:12; Acts 20:17, 28; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24; Eph. 4:11-12; I Cor. 12:28; Matt. 28:18-20; John 18:36</li>
</ol>
<p>THE  principle  designated  Erastianism,  which  has  been  practically embodied in  all  the  State  Churches  of  the  0ld  World,  includes  the following elements: -- 1. That the Church is an organ of the State to accomplish one of its general functions; and consequently that there is no government of the Church independent of that of the State, but that its officers,  its  laws,  and  their  administration,  are  in  all  things subject to the civil government. 2. That all the subjects of the State are,  ipso  facto,  members  of  the  Church,  and  entitled  to  all  its ordinances.  3.  That  the  duties  and  prerogatives  of  church  officers include  simply  the  functions  of  teaching  and  administering  the ordinances, and do not include discipline, because, according to this view,  to  exclude  a  man  from  church  ordinances  is  to  deny  him  his civil rights as a citizen.</p>
<p>In opposition to this doctrine, our Confession in this section teaches --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That our Lord Jesus Christ, as mediatorial King, has appointed a government for his Church; and --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  this  church  government  is  distinct  in  all  respects  from  the civil government.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Christ the God-man, as mediatorial King, by his inspired apostles and their writings appointed a government for his Church; and by his providence and Spirit he continues graciously to administer it to the end of time. Hence the Church is a Theocratic kingdom. All authority and power descends, and does not ascend. Pastors and elders teach and rule in the name of God, and not of man. It is the commission of Christ, and not of the Church, that the minister carries with him, and by  authority  of  which  he  acts.  The  Church  only  witnesses  to  the genuineness  of this commission,  and  sees  that  it is faithfully discharged by the bearer of it. Hence all the power of church officers, either  in  their  several  or  collective  capacity,  is  ministerial  and declarative. They have only to define what Christ has taught, to carry that teaching to all men, and to execute the laws he has given, and to administer the penalties he has designated, according to his will and in his name.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  Theocratic  government  of  the  Church  which  Christ  has established is entirely independent of the civil government. To very many  in  Europe  it  appeared  impossible  that  two  independent governments should exercise jurisdiction at the same time over the same subjects without constant collision. But the experience of the dissenting bodies and free churches of Great Britain, and of all the churches in America, abundantly proves that there is no danger of interference whatever, when both the Church and the State confine themselves to their respective provinces. The persons subject to the jurisdiction of the government of the Church are also subject to the jurisdiction of the government of the State; but the ends, the laws, the methods and the sanctions of the two are so different, that the one never can any more interfere with the other than waves of colour can interfere with vibrations of sound.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While all Christians, with the exception of the Erastians, agree with the two principles taught in this section as thus generally stated, they differ  very  much  as  to  the  human  agents  with  whom  Christ  has deposited  this  power,  and  whom  he  uses  as  his  instruments  in administering it.  There  are  four  radically  different  theories  on  this subject:  --  "(1.)  The  Popish  theory,  which  assumes  that  Christ,  the apostles, and believers constituted the Church while our Saviour was on  earth,  and  that  this  organization  was  designed  to  be  perpetual. After the ascension of our Lord, Peter became his vicar, and took his place as the visible head of the Church. This primacy of Peter, as the universal  bishop,  is  continued  in  his  successors,  the  bishops  of Rome; and the apostleship is perpetuated in the order of prelates. As in  the  primitive  Church  no  one  could  be  an  apostle  who  was  not subject to Christ, so now no one can be a prelate who is not subject to the  Pope.  And  as  then  no  one  could  be  a  Christian  who  was  not subject to Christ, and the apostles, so now no one can be a Christian who is not subject to the Pope and the prelates. This is the Romish theory  of  the  Church:  A  vicar  of  Christ,  a  perpetual  college  of apostles, and the people subject to their infallible control.</p>
<ul>
<li>"(2.) The Prelatical theory assumes the perpetuity of the apostleship as  the  governing  power  in  the  Church,  which  therefore  consists  of those  who  profess  the  true  religion  and  are  subject  to  apostlebishops. This is the Anglican or High Church form of this theory. In its Low Church form the prelatical theory simply teaches that there was originally a threefold order in the ministry, and that there should be  now.  But  it  does  not  affirm  that  mode  of  organization  to  be essential.</li>
<li>" (3.) The  Independent  or  Congregational  theory  includes  two principles:  first,  that  the  governing  and  executive  power  in  the Church  is in the brotherhood;  and  secondly, that the church organization  is  complete  in  each  worshipping  assembly,  which  is independent of every other.</li>
</ul>
<p>"  (4.)  The  fourth  theory  is  the  Presbyterian......  This  includes  the following  affirmative  statement:  (a.)  The  people  have  a  right  to  a substantive  part  in  the  government  of  the  Church.  (b.)  Presbyters, who labour in word and doctrine, are the highest permanent officers of the Church, and all belong to the same order. (c.) The outward and visible Church is, or should be, one, in the sense that a smaller part is subject to a larger, and a larger to the whole. It is not holding one of these  principles  that  makes  a  man  a  Presbyterian,  but  his  holding them  all."  Christ  has  in  fact  vested  all  ecclesiastical  power  in  the Church as a whole, none of its members being excluded; yet not in the  Church  as  a  mob,  but  as  an  organized  body  consisting  of members,  their representative ruling elders, and ministers or bishops.  Elders  or  bishops  were  ordained  by  the  apostles,  have always continued in the Church, and were designed to be perpetuated as the highest class of officers in the Church. 1 Tim. iii. 1; Eph. iv. 11,  12.  All  Church  power  vests,  then,  jointly  in  the  lay  and clerical elements, in the ministers together with the people.</p>
<p>" Ruling  elders  are  properly  the  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THE PEOPLE, chosen by them for the purpose of exercising government and  discipline  in conjunction  with  pastors  or  ministers."  "The powers, therefore, exercised by our ruling elders are powers which belong to the lay members of the Church." " They are chosen by them to act in their name in the government of the Church. A representative is one chosen by others to do in their name what they are  entitled  to  do  in  their  own  persons;  or  rather  to  exercise  the powers  which  radically  inhere  in  those  for  whom  they  act.  The members  of  a  State  Legislature  or  of  Congress,  for  example,  can exercise only those powers which are inherent in the people."</p>
<p>SECTION: II To these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed;  by  virtue  whereof,  they  have  power,  respectively,  to retain, and remit sins; to shut that kingdom against the impenitent, both  by  the  Word,  and  censures;  and  to  open  it  unto  penitent sinners,  by  the  ministry  of  the  gospel;  and  by  absolution  from censures, as occasion shall require.[2]</p>

<p>SECTION: III Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethren, for deterring of others from the  like offenses, for purging out of that leaven which might infect the whole lump, for vindicating the honor of Christ, and the holy profession of the gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the church, if they should suffer his covenant, and the seals thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.[3]</p>

<p>SECTION: IV For the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the  church  are  to  proceed  by  admonition;  suspension  from  the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for a season; and by excommunication  from  the  church;  according  to  the  nature  of  the crime, and demerit of the person.[4]</p>

<p>These sections teach --</p>

<li>As  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  power  conferred  upon  the Church of admitting and excluding from the fold, and of disciplining its members.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As to the ends of this discipline.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>3.. As to the methods through which it should be administered.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>All Church power must be exercised in an orderly manner through the  officers  spoken  of  above,  freely  chosen  for  this  purpose  by  the brethren; and it relates --" (1.) To matters of doctrine. She has a right to set forth a public declaration of the truths which she believes, and which  are  to  be  acknowledged.  by  all  who  enter  her  communion. That is, she has a right to frame creeds or confessions of faith, as her</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>testimony for the truth and her protest against error. And as she has been commissioned to teach all nations, she has the right of selecting teachers, of judging of their fitness, of ordaining and sending them forth  into  the  field,  and  of  recalling  and  deposing  them  when unfaithful.  (2.)  The  Church  has  power  to  set  down  rules  for  the ordering of public worship. (3.) She has power to make rules for her own government; such as every Church has in its book of discipline, constitution  or  canons,  etc.  (4.)  She  has  power  to  receive  into fellowship, and to exclude the unworthy from her own communion."</p>
<p>This last power is commonly styled "the power of the keys;" i.e., of operating  and  closing  the  doors  of  the  Church,  of  admitting  or excluding  from  sealing  ordinances.  Matt.  xvi.  19.  In  view  of  two unquestionable  facts  --  (a.)  to  forgive  sin  is  an  incommunicable attribute of God and Christ; (b.) God has given to no class of men the faculty  of  absolutely  discriminating  the  good  from  the  bad  --  it follows  that  the  Church  power  of  opening  and  shutting,  of  binding and loosing, spoken of in Matt. xvi. 19 and in the second section of this  chapter,  is  purely  ministerial  and  declarative.  Church  censures declare simply what is, to the best of their knowledge, in the opinion of the Church officers pronouncing them, the mind and will of Christ in the case. And they have direct binding effect only in so far as the relation of the  person  censured  to  the  visible  Church  is  concerned. They can have effect upon the relations of the censured to God and to Christ only in so far as they represent the will of Christ in the case, and because they do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The ends of Church discipline are declared. to be -- (1.) The purity of the Church, and hence the glory and approbation of God. (2.) The recovery of the erring brother himself. (3.) The force of example to deter others from like sin. (4.) The exhibition of righteousness and fidelity to principle presented to the world without.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  better  to  attain  all  these  ends,  for  which  the  discipline  is intended, the Church officers should --</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(1.) Proceed  in  a  regular  order  to  administer  discipline,  using, according  to  their  character,  first  all  means  of  moral  reclamation before  they  proceed  to  absolute  exclusion.  The  proper  method  of procedure, under all circumstances, is plainly stated in the "Book of Discipline,"  which  forms  part  of  the  Confession  of  Faith  of  our Church. The successive stages of discipline there unfolded are -- (a.) private  admonition,  (b.)  public  admonition,  (c.)  suspension,  (d.) excommunication.</li>
<li>(2.) The discipline should be wisely and justly proportioned "to the nature of the crime and demerit of the person."</li>

<p>SECTION I. For the better government, and further edification of the church,  there  ought  to  be  such  assemblies  as  are  commonly  called synods  or  councils:[1]  and  it  belongeth  to  the  overseers  and  other rulers  of  the  particular  churches,  by  virtue  of  their  office,  and  the power  which  Christ  hath  given  them  for  edification  and  not  for destruction, to appoint such assemblies;[2] and to convene together in them, as often as they shall judge it expedient for the good of the church.

<p>Acts 15:1-35; 20:17</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have seen in the last chapter, a11 Church power is vested by Christ in the Church as a whole -- not as a mob, but as an organized body. As organized, the Church consists of presbyters or bishops and the  people,  and  the  people  as  represented  by  lay  or  ruling  elders. This necessarily gives origin to the session or parochial presbytery, consisting of the bishop or pastor, and the ruling elders or representatives  of  the  people.  In  this  body  the  entire  ecclesiastical power of the whole congregation is vested. It  admits  candidates  to sealing  ordinances,  exercises  pastoral  care  and  discipline  over  the members,  provides  for  the  instruction  of  the  flock,  and  regulates public worship.</p>
<p>In the Episcopal Church this governing power vests with the rector. In  the  Congregational  Churches  it  is  exercised  immediately  by  the whole body of the brotherhood in person. In the Presbyterian Church it  vests  with  pastor  and  people  --  the  people,  however,  acting  only through their permanent representatives, the ruling elders.</p>
<p>But  the  third  great  principle  of  Presbyterianism,  as  stated  in  the preceding chapter,  is,  that  the  whole  Church  of  Christ  on  earth  "is one in such a sense that a smaller part is subject to a larger, and a larger  to  the  whole.  It  has  one  Lord,  one  faith,  one  baptism.  The principles of government laid down in the Scriptures bind the whole</p>
<p>Church.  The  terms  of  admission  and  the  legitimate  grounds  of exclusion  are  everywhere  the  same.  The  same  qualifications  are everywhere to be demanded for admission to the sacred office, and the same grounds for deposition. Every man who is properly received as a member of a particular church becomes a member of the Church universal; every one rightfully excluded from a particular church is excluded from the whole Church: everyone rightfully ordained to the ministry  in  one  church  is  a  minister  of  the  universal  Church;  and when  rightfully  deposed  in  one  he  ceases  to  be  a  minister  in  any. Hence, while every particular church has a right to manage its own affairs  and  administer  its  own  discipline,  it  cannot  be  independent and irresponsible in the exercise of that right. As its members are the members of the Church universal, and those whom it excommunicates  are,  according  to  the  Scriptural  theory,  delivered unto Satan and cut off from the communion of the saints, the acts of a  particular  church  become  the  acts  of  the  whole  Church,  and therefore  the  whole  has  a  right  to  see  that  they  are  performed according to the law of Christ. Hence, on the one hand, the right of appeal; and, on the other, the right of review and control."</p>
<p>The principle contained in the above statement was certainly acted upon in the apostolic age, and it has been practically recognized and acted upon with more or less fidelity in all branches of the Christian Church ever since.</p>
<p>"  A  controversy  having  arisen  in  the  church  at  Antioch  concerning the  Mosaic  law,  instead  of  settling  it  among  themselves  as  an independent body, they referred the case to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem;  and  there  it  was  authoritatively  decided  (not  by  the apostles  alone,  but  '  by  the  apostles  and  elders,  with  the  whole church,' Acts xv. 22) -- not for that church (Antioch) only, but for all others. Paul, therefore, in his next missionary journey, as he passed through the cities, ' delivered to them,' it is said, ' the decrees for to keep,  that  were  ordained  of  the  apostles  and  elders  which  were  at Jerusalem.'  Acts  xvi.  4."  Hence,  in  carrying  these  principles  into effect,  the  constitution  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  provides  for  the erection and operation of a regularly graduated series of ecclesiastical councils.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Every particular congregation is governed, as we have seen, by a Session  or  Parochial  Presbytery,  consisting  of  its  pastor  and  the ruling elders as the representatives of the people. The  whole governmental power of that particular church vests in that session, and all trials for, e discipline  of  any  of  its  members  must  originate there. Its decisions are final with respect to the matters subject to its jurisdiction, except when, after having been regularly carried up by appeal, they have been reversed by a superior court.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There is the Classical Presbytery, which consists of all the pastors or  bishops  and  the  churches  in  a  city  or  neighbourhood  who  can conveniently meet together and unite in the exercise of ecclesiastical government. The churches appear in the Presbytery by representatives from the sessions of particular churches, so regulated that the number of lay representatives shall exactly equal the number of  pastors;  and  these  representatives  of  the  people  in  all  respects exercise equal power with the pastors. All the powers of these bodies vest in them as bodies, and not in the members severally. Whatever they are competent to decide or to execute can be done only by the members jointly while in session, and not at all by them separately, or  even  jointly  in  any  other  capacity.  Ordained  ministers  are  not members of particular churches, but belong in the first instance to the  Presbytery.  The  Presbytery,  therefore,  in  the  first  instance, examines  and  decides  upon  the  qualifications  of  candidates  and licenses  and  ordains  them;  and  in  the  case  of  the  discipline  of  a minister the process originates in the Presbytery, to which alone the pastor is directly responsible. A licentiate is in no sense or degree a minister,  He  is  purely  a  layman  --  i.e.,  a  private  member  of  a particular church -- taken under care of a Presbytery experimentally, and  as  a  part  of  his  trials  or  tests  temporarily  allowed  to  preach before the people, that they may pass their final judgment upon his qualifications and acceptability as a candidate for the ministry.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Synods are only large Presbyteries, consisting of all the Presbyteries in full of a province.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  General  Assembly  of  the  whole  Church,  which,  like  all  the other  bodies,  consists  of  an  equal  number  of  pastors  and  of  the representatives  of  the  people,  of  necessity  is composed  of  the representatives of the constituent Presbyteries, instead of the Presbyteries themselves in full.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In virtue of the principle of APPEAL, any question originating in a church session, or in any other subordinate court, may be carried up in succession through all the series to the General Assembly, whose decisions when once made are final.</p>
<p>In virtue of the principle of REVIEW AND CONTROL, each church court  of  every  grade  above  a  church  session  has  the  right,  and  is under  obligation,  to  review  "the  records  of  the  proceedings  of  the judicatory next below;" and of course to judge of those proceedings, and secure their correction when wrong. And each court, including the  church  session,  is  an  executive  as  well  as  a  judicial  body;  and therefore has an inherent right of supervision and of governmental control  over  the  entire  field  subject  to  its  jurisdiction.  Hence  a superior  judicatory,  in  default  of  the  proper  action  of  the  inferior judicatory to which the case more  immediately  belongs, may inaugurate investigation and apply discipline immediately in the case of any person within its legitimate bounds.</p>
<p>SECTION  II.  It  belongeth  to  synods  and  councils,  ministerially  to determine  controversies  of  faith,  and  cases  of  conscience;  to  set down  rules  and  directions  for  the  better  ordering  of  the  public worship of God, and government of his church; to receive complaints in cases of maladministration, and authoritatively to determine the same: which decrees and determinations, if consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence and submission; not only for their agreement with the Word, but also for the power whereby they are made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his Word.[4]</p>
<ol>
<li>Acts 15:15, 19, 24, 27-31; 16:4; Matt. 18:17-20</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION  III.  All  synods  or  councils,  since  the  Apostles'  times, whether  general  or  particular,  may  err;  and  many  have  erred. Therefore they are not to be made the rule of faith, or practice; but to be used as a help in both.[5]</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION  IV.  Synods  and  councils  are  to  handle,  or  conclude nothing, but that which is ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs which concern the commonwealth, unless by way of humble  petition  in  cases  extraordinary;  or,  by  way  of  advice,  for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto required by the civil magistrate.[6]</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These sections  state  --  1.  The  different  subjects  which  come  before these  Church  courts  for  decision.  2.  The  grounds  upon  which,  and the  conditions  under  which,  their  decisions  are  to  be  regarded  as requiring submission, and the extent to which that submission is to be carried.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Negatively. Synods  and  councils  have  no  right  whatever  to intermeddle with any affair which concerns the commonwealth; and they  have  no  right  to  presume  to  give  advice  to,  or  to  attempt  to influence, the officers of the civil government in their action as civil officers, except (1.) in extraordinary cases, where the interests of the Church are immediately concerned, by the way of humble petition, or (2.) by  way  of  advice  for  satisfaction  of  conscience,  if  they  be thereunto required by the civil magistrate.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Negatively. The  powers  of synods and  councils are purely ministerial and declarative; i.e., relate simply to the declaration and execution of the will of Christ. They are therefore wholly judicial and. executive, and in no instance legislative.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Positively. It belongs to synods and councils at proper times (1.) To form creeds and confessions of faith, and to adopt a constitution for the government of the Church. (2.) To determine particular controversies  of  faith  and  cases  of  conscience.  (3.)  To  prescribe regulations for the public worship of God, and for the government of the Church. (4.) To take up and issue all cases of discipline; and, in the case of the superior courts, to receive appeals and complaints in all  cases  of  maladministration  in  the  case  of  individual  officers  or subordinate courts, and authoritatively to determine the same.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Positively.  While  ecclesiastical  courts  have  no  right  to  handle  or advise  upon  matters  which  belong  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  civil magistrate, they, on the other hand, evidently possess an inalienable right of teaching church members their duty with respect to the civil powers,  and  of  enforcing  the  performance  of  it  as  a  religious obligation. "The powers that be are ordained of God......Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for  conscience' sake." Rom. xiii. 1 -- 7. That is, obedience to the civil authorities is a religious  duty,  and  may  be  taught  and  enforced  by  Church  courts upon Church members.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Negatively.  All  synods  and  councils  since  the  apostles'  times, whether  general  or  particular,  may  err,  and  many  have  erred; therefore they are not to be made the rule of faith or practice; but to be  used  as  a  help  in  both.  That  is,  these  synods  and  councils, consisting of uninspired men, have no power to bind the conscience, and their authority cannot exclude the right, nor excuse the obligation,  of  private  judgment.  If  their  judgments  are  unwise,  but not directly opposed to the will of God, the private member should submit for peace' sake. If their decisions are opposed plainly to the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Word of God, the private member should disregard them and take the penalty.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Positively.  But  in  every  case  in  which  the  decrees  of  these ecclesiastical courts are consonant to the Word of God, they are to be received  by  all  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  said  court,  not  only because of the fact that they do agree with the Word of God, but also because of the proper authority of the court itself as a court of Jesus Christ,  appointed  by  him,  and  therefore  ministerially  representing him in all of its legitimate actions.</li>

<p>SECTION I. The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption:[1] but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them: [2] the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies.[3] And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.[4]  Besides  these  two  places,  for  souls  separated  from  their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth none.</p>

<p>This section teaches --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That man consists of two distinct elements, a soul and a body; and that death consists in their temporary separation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  while  the  body  is  resolved  into  its  constituent  chemical elements, the soul of the believer is (1.) Immediately made perfect in</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>holiness; (2.) During all the intermediate state, from death until the resurrection, continues conscious, active, and happy; and (3.) Is in the presence of Christ, who, after his ascension, sat down at the right hand of God.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the souls of the wicked also continue, during this intermediate  state,  conscious  and  active,  but  in  a  state  of  penal torment, reserved to the judgment of the great day.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>These conditions, though not final, are irreversible -- i.e., none of those with Christ will be ever lost, and none of those in torment will be ever saved.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Scriptures afford no ground whatever for the Romish doctrine that there are other places or conditions occupied by deceased men than the two above mentioned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  duality  of  human  nature,  as  consisting  of  two  separable elements  --  a  soul  and  a  body  --  having  distinct  and  independent attributes  and  subsistence,  is  taken  for  granted  and  constantly implied in the language of Scripture. Thus God made the body out of the dust of the earth, and breathed into it the breath of life; "and so man became a living soul." Gen. ii. 7. Christ bids us not to "fear them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul." Matt. x. 28. And death  is  defined  in  Eccles.  xii.  7,  as  a  dissolution  of  the  personal union of these two elements; for " then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." In like  manner  Paul  (2  Cor.  v.  8;  Phil.  i.  22  --  24)  defines  it  as  a departing, a being with Christ, a ceasing to abide in the flesh, a being absent from the body on the part of the conscious personal soul.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>We know that when the soul leaves it the body is resolved into its original  chemical  elements,  which  are  gradually  incorporated  with the  shifting  currents  of  matter  on  the  surface  of  the  Earth.  The Scriptures  teach  us,  however,  that,  in  spite  of  this  flux  of  their material  constituents,  the  real  identity  of  our  bodies  is  preserved;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and that, as members of Christ, all that is essential to them will be ultimately preserved and brought to a glorious resurrection.</p>
<p>As  to  the  condition  and  location  of  the  souls  of  men  during  the interval which elapses between the death of each individual and the general and simultaneous resurrection of the bodies of all, what the Scriptures teach us may be summed up under the following heads: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  The  souls  of  both  believers  and  the  reprobate  continue  after death conscious and active, although they remain until the resurrection separate from their bodies.</li>
<li>(2.) The souls of believers are at their death made perfect in holiness.</li>
<li>(3.) The souls of believers, thus perfected, are immediately introduced into the presence of Christ, and continue to enjoy bright revelations of God and the society of the holy angels.</li>
<li>(4.) The souls of the reprobate are at once introduced into the place provided  for  the  devil  and  his  angels,  and  continue  in  unutterable misery.</li>
<li>(5.) This state of both classes admits of no exchange or transfer, but their present  condition  is the commencement  of  an  inevitable progression in opposite directions. Nevertheless, it is intermediate in the  sense  (a.)  That  the  persons  of  men  continue  incomplete  while their souls and bodies are separate. (b.) That neither the redemption of  the  saved  nor  the  perdition  of  the  lost  has  yet  reached  its  final stage. (c.) That possibly in the case of the latter, and very probably in the case of the redeemed, the localities in which they are at present are  not  the  same  as  those  in  which  they  are  to  dwell  permanently after the final award.</li>
<li>(6.) As to the location of the place in which the souls of the reprobate suffer, the Scriptures give us no clue. In Jude, verse 6, it is said, "The angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he  hath  reserved  in  everlasting  chains  under  darkness  unto  the</li>
</ul>
<p>judgment of the great day." In Matt. xxv. 41, the Judge at the last day says  to  those  on  the  left  hand,  "Depart  from  me,  ye  cursed,  into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." The rich man "  lifted  up  his  eyes  in  hell,  being  in  torments,"  while  his  brethren were  still  alive  on  earth.  Luke  xvi.  23.  But  where  these  places  are situated,  and  whether  the  locality  of  torment  now  is  identical  with the locality of torment after the judgment, no man can tell, because God has not revealed it. Of course, the terms "up" or "down," "under" or "above," applied to such a subject, must be simply metaphorical, and cannot indicate absolute direction when addressed promiscuously to the inhabitants of a revolving and rotating sphere.</p>
<p>(7.)  As  to  the  location  of  the  place  where  the  redeemed  are  now gathered,  absolutely  nothing  is  revealed,  except  that  it  is  wherever the glorified humanity of Christ is. They are with him, and behold his glory.  2  Cor.  v.  1  --  8.  See,  also,  all  the  scenes  opened  in  the Apocalypse. And Christ, at his ascension, sat down at "the right hand of God," "the right hand of the Majesty on high." Mark xvi. 19; Rom. viii.  34;  Heb.  i.  3;  x.  12,  etc.  This  must  be  a  locality,  because,  the humanity of Christ being finite, his presence marks a definite place; yet  the  phrase  "right  hand  of  God"  evidently  marks  rather  the condition of honour  and  power  to  which Christ is raised as mediatorial King. As to the location of the place in which Christ and his glorified spouse will hold their central home throughout eternity, a  strong probability is raised that it will be our present Earth; first burned with fire and then gloriously replenished. See Rom. viii. 19 -23; 2 Pet. iii. 5 -- 13; Rev. xxi. l.</p>
<p>The  proof  of  the  main  propositions  above  stated  --  viz.,  that  the intermediate state of souls is one of conscious activity, the redeemed being perfectly holy and happy with Christ, and the reprobate being with the devil and his angels in torment, and that these conditions are for ever irreversible -- can be better presented collectively than distributively.  It  is  as  follows:  The  reappearance  of  Samuel  in  a conscious state, in the use of all his faculties, at the call of Saul and the witch of En-dor (1 Sam. xxviii. 7 -- 20); the appearance of Moses and Elias at the transfiguration of Christ on the mount  (Matt.  xvii. 3); Christ's address to the thief on the cross --" Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Luke xxiii. 43); the parable of the rich man and Lazarus  (Luke  xvi.  23,  24)  --  Lazarus  is  conscious  and  active  in Abraham's  bosom  --  the  rich  man  is  in  conscious  torment  in  Hell (Hades),  while  his  brethren  are  still  living  in  the  flesh.  Of  dying Stephen it is declared (Acts vii. 55 -- 59) that, being full of the Holy Ghost, he saw the heavens opened, and Jesus Christ standing at the right hand of God; and so seeing he cried, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit," and so died.</p>
<p>In 2 Cor. v. 1 -- 8, Paul declares that to be " at home in the body" is to be "absent from the Lord;" and to be "absent from the body" is to the believer to be " present with the Lord:" and hence he says (in Phil. i. 21  --  24)  that  for  him  "to  die  is  gain,"  and  that  he  was  "in  a  strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and be with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you." In  1  Thess  v.  10,  Paul  declares  that  the  sleep  of  death  is  a  "living together with Christ." In Eph. iii. 15, the Church is declared to be one whole family, of which at present part is in heaven and part on earth. In  Heb.  vi.  12  --  20,  it  is  declared  that  after  Abraham  (and  other ancient  saints)  "had  patiently  endured,  he  obtained  the  promises;" which promises, we know, were in their true meaning spiritual and heavenly. In Acts i. 25, Judas is said to have gone "to his own place." In  Jude 6, 7,  the  lost  angels  are  said  to  be  "reserved  in  everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." In Heb. xii. 23, the spirits of the just are  represented  as  "made  perfect,"  and  happy  with  the  angels  in heaven. In Rev. vi. 9 -- 11, the souls of the martyrs are represented as under the altar in heaven, praying for the punishment of their former persecutors on earth, which of course must be before the resurrection. In Rev. v. 9; vii. 9; xiv. 1, 3, the souls of believers are represented as being now with Christ and the holy angels.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Our  Standards  declare  that  there  is  no  foundation  whatever,  in Scripture,  for  the  Romish  doctrine  as  to  the  intermediate  state  of</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>deceased  men.  The  Papists  hold  that  Hades  or  the  under  world embraces  several  distinct  regions,  to  which  different  classes  of human souls are destined: (1.) The souls of unbaptized infants go to the  "Limbus  Infantum,"  where  they  remain  without  suffering,  and yet  without  the  vision  of  God.  (2.)  Old  Testament  believers  were gathered in the " Limbus Patrurm," where, without suffering, and yet without the vision of God, they remained the "spirits in prison," until Christ, during the three days he continued under the power of death, went and released them. 1 Pet. iii. 19, 20. (3.) All unbaptized adults, and those who have subsequently lost the grace of baptism, and die unreconciled to the Church, go immediately to the permanent Hell. (4.) All Christians who have attained a state of Christian perfection go immediately to Heaven. (5.) The great mass of partially sanctified Christians,  dying  in  communion  with  the  Church,  still  cumbered with imperfections, go to Purgatory. (Cat. Rom., pt. i., ch. vi.)</p>
<p>Concerning purgatory, the Council of Trent teaches -- (a.) That there is a purifying fire through which imperfect Christians must pass. (b.) That souls in purgatory may be benefited by the prayers and masses offered in their behalf on earth. (Counc. Trent, sess. xxv.)</p>
<p>This  doctrine  is  false, because  --  (1.) It is nowhere  taught  in Scripture.  (2.)  It  is  opposed  to  the  teaching  of  Scripture  as  to  the intermediate state, as above shown. (3.) It rests upon Anti-Christian principles as to the efficacy of the atonement of Christ, as to the sinexpiating and soul-purifying efficacy of temporary suffering, as to the sacrifice of the mass, and as to prayers for the dead, etc.</p>
<p>SECTION II. At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed:[5] and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies,  and  none  other  (although  with  different  qualities),  which shall be united again to their souls forever.[6]</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>SECTION III. The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be  raised  to  dishonor:  the  bodies  of  the  just,  by  his  Spirit,  unto honor; and be made conformable to his own glorious body.[7]</p>

<li>Acts 24:15; John 5:25-29; I Cor. 15:43; Phil. 3:21</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These sections teach --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That at the last day there will be a simultaneous resurrection of all the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That those who then remain living on the Earth shall not die, but be changed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  very  same  bodies  that  are  buried  in  the  earth  shall  be raised and reunited to their souls, their identity preserved, although their qualities will be changed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  bodies  of  believers  shall  be  made  like  Christ's  glorious body --" a spiritual body."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the bodies of the reprobate shall be raised to dishonour.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>At the last day there will be a simultaneous resurrection of all the dead, both of the just and the unjust: "And many of them that sleep in  the  dust  of  the  earth  shall  awake,  some  to  everlasting  life,  and some to shame and everlasting contempt." Dan. xii. 2. "Marvel not at this:  for  the  hour  is  coming,  in  the  which  all  that  are  in  the  graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John v. 28, 29. The two classes are to be judged  simultaneously,  immediately  after  their  resurrection,  upon the  second coining of the  Lord.  The  sheep  shall  stand  on  the  right side,  and  the  goats  upon  the  left.  "And  these  shall  go  away  into everlasting  punishment;  but  the  righteous  into  life  eternal."  Matt. xxv. 31-46; Rom. ii. 6 -- 16; 2 Thess. i. 6 -- 10; Rev. xx. 11 -- 15.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Those who are alive and remain unto the conning of the Lord shall not  outstrip  them  which  are  asleep.  "  For  the  Lord  himself  shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." 1 Thess. iv. 15 -- 17. " We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The very same bodies that are buried in the earth shall be raised and reunited to their souls -- their identity preserved, although their qualities are changed. This is explicitly declared in Scripture: " Our vile body is to be changed." Phil. iii. 21. " This corruptible is to put on incorruption." 1 Cor. xv. 53, 54. "A11 that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth." John v. 28. "They who are asleep, ...... the dead in Christ shall rise." 1 Thess. iv. 13 -- 17. Our bodies are now  members  of  Christ,  and  they  are  to  be  raised  in  a  manner analogous  to  his  resurrection,  which  we  know  to  have  been  of  his identical body by the print of the nails and of the spear. It was seen and handled for the space of forty days in order to establish this very fact. Luke xxiv. 39; Acts i. 3; 1 Cor. xv. 4.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There  are  many  changes  in  the  material  elements  and  form  of  the human  body  between  birth  and  death,  and  yet  no  one  can  for  a moment doubt that the body remains one and the same throughout all.  There  is  no  difficulty  in  believing,  upon  the  authority  of  God's Word,  that,  in  spite  of  the  lapse  of  time  and  of  all  the  changes, whether  of  matter  or  of  form,  it undergoes,  the  body  of  the resurrection will be in the same sense and to the same degree one with the body of death as the body of death is one with the body of birth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>These  changes  will  doubtless  be  very  great.  The  body  of  the believer is to be made " like unto Christ's glorious body." Phil. iii. 21.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of man now is " an animal body "-- unhappily translated "a natural body" (1 Cor. xv. 44). It is suited to the present wants of man; to  his  present  stage  of  development, intellectual, moral, social, and spiritual; and to the physical conditions of the world he inhabits. But "flesh  and  blood" --  bone,  muscle, and nerve --" cannot inherit the kingdom  of  God;  neither  doth  corruption  inherit  incorruption."  1 Cor.  xv.  50.  But  this  shall  be  "  changed;  "--  not  a  new  body substituted for the old, but the old changed into the new. As the seed gives birth to a new organism, so the corruptible will give birth to the incorruptible; for "there is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body." The spiritual body will be still material and identical with the body which was once animal: but it will be suited to the new wants of "the  spirits of just men  made  perfect;"  to  their  new  stage  of development, intellectual and spiritual; to their social relations; and to the physical conditions of the " new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Pet. iii. 12, 13.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The bodies of the reprobate shall be raised to dishonour. "All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth,......they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John v. 28, 29.</li>

<p>SECTION I.  God  hath  appointed  a  day,  wherein  he  will  judge  the world, in righteousness, by Jesus Christ [1], to whom all power and judgment  is  given  of  the  Father.[2]  In  which  day,  not  only  the apostate angels shall be judged.[3] but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.[4]</p>

<p>SECTION  II.  The  end  of  God's  appointing  this  day  is  for  the manifestation of the glory of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of his justice, in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked  and  disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.[5]</p>

<p>THESE sections teach --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That God has appointed a day of general judgment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That he has committed this judgment into the hands of the Godman in his character as Mediator.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  persons  to  be  judged  include  apostate  angels  and  the whole human race, good and bad.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That these persons are to be judged as to all their thoughts, words, and deeds.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  the  great  end  of  God  in  the  appointment  of  this  day  is  the manifestation  of  his  glorious  justice  in  the  condemnation  of  the reprobate, and of his glorious grace in the glorification of believers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the righteous are to be awarded admission to the presence of the  Lord,  which  is  to  be  consciously  enjoyed  by  them  in  a  state  of unending holiness, happiness, and honour.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That the reprobate are to be awarded a place with the devil and his angels, to be endured with conscious torment and shame through a ceaseless eternity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It is a dictate of natural reason and conscience that in some way, formally or informally, severally or collectively, God will call all the subjects  of  his  moral  government  to  an  exact  account  for  their character and actions. It is obvious -- as the author of the seventythird  Psalm  declares,  and  as  many  other  perplexed  souls  have thought --  that  justice  is  not  executed  upon  men  in  this  world.  All this suggests the probability that God will at a future time adjust the disturbed balances  and  call all men  to  a  strict account. This presumption of reason and conscience is confirmed and declared to be  a  fact  in  the  Word  of  God;  and  the  additional  information  is conveyed that this judgment of men and angels shall be general and simultaneous,  and  shall  be  conducted  on  a  certain  predetermined day in the future. " The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now  commandeth  all  men  everywhere  to  repent:  because  he  hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead." Acts xvii. 30, 31; Rom. ii. 16; Matt. xxv. 31 -- 46.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Judge  on  this  great  occasion  is  to  be,  not  God  absolutely considered,  but  the  God-man  in  his  office  as  mediatorial  King.  All judgment is said to be, not inherently his, but committed to him by the Father. John v. 22, 27. As Judge he is called "the Son of man" and "the  man  ordained  by  God."  Matt.  xxv.  31,  32;  Acts  xvii.  31.  He conducts the judgment as "the King," and as Head of his members who have  lived  on  earth.  "For  I  was  an  hungred,  and  ye  gave  me meat;  I  was  thirsty,  and  ye  gave  me  drink.......  And  the  King  shall answer  and  say  unto  them,  Verily  I  say  unto  you,  Inasmuch  as  ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Matt. xxv. 35, 40. And thus, as mediatorial King, he will consummate his work in the destruction of his enemies, the complete redemption of his friends, and "the restitution of all things." 2 Thess. i. 7 -- 10; Rev. i. 7; Acts iii. 21.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The subjects of the judgment will embrace the entire human race of every generation, each individual appearing immediately after his</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>resurrection,  in  the  completeness  of  his  reintegrated  person,  both soul and body. All the generations of the dead are to be raised and the then living " changed." "Before him shall be gathered all nations." " We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed; ...... the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." "And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God....... And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell (Hades) delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged, every man according to their  works."  Matt.  xxv.  31  --  40;  1  Cor.  xv.  51,  52;  2  Cor.  v.  10;  1 Thess. iv. 16; Rev. xx. 11 -- 15. All evil angels are also to be arraigned in this judgment. " The angels which kept not their first estate ...... he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." Jude 6; 2 Pet. ii. 4. Good angels will be concerned  in  it  as  attendants  and  ministers.  Matt.  xiii.  41,  42;  2 Thess. i. 7, 8.</p>
<ol>
<li>The judgment will not rest upon appearances, nor testimony, nor any  partial  knowledge  of  the  facts,  nor  upon  technical  grounds  of law, nor specific actions dissociated from the state of the heart and the  motives  which  prompted  them.  The  heathen  who  has  sinned without the law " shall be judged without the law;" that is, without the  law  supernaturally  revealed,  but  by  the  law  written  upon  the heart, which made him a law unto himself. Luke xii. 47, 48; Rom. ii. 12 -- 15. The Jew who "sinned in the law shall be judged by the law." Rom. ii. 12. Every man who has lived under the dispensation of the gospel shall be judged by the gospel. Heb. ii. 2, 3; x. 28, 29. We are told  not  to  judge  according  to  the  appearance  (John  vii.  24);  and therefore to "judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest  the  counsels  of  the  hearts."  1  Cor.  iv.  5;  Eccles.  xii.  14.  " There is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.  Therefore  whatsoever  ye  have  spoken  in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops." Luke viii.  17;  xii.  2,  3;  Mark  iv.  22.  This  shall  be  done  to  manifest  the righteousness  of  God  in  the  condemnation  of  his  enemies,  and  his glorious grace in the sanctification of his people.</li>
</ol>
<p>The saints will not be acquitted in the day of judgment on the ground of their own good deeds, but because their names are found "written in  the  book  of  life,"  or  the  book  of  God's  electing  love,  and  on  the ground  of  their  participation  in  the  righteousness  of  Christ.  Their good deeds will be publicly cited as the evidences of their union with Christ.  Their  union  with  Christ  is  the  ground  of  their  justification. Their  faith  is  the  instrument  of  their  union  with  Christ;  and  their faith, as the Apostle James says, is shown by their works. Phil. iv. 3; Rev. iii. 5; xiii. 8; xx. 12, 15.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  great  end  of  God  in  this  public  unveiling  of  secrets  and manifestation of character in connection with his final disposition of his  creatures,  is,  of  course,  the  manifestation  of  his  own  glorious excellencies as moral Governor and Redeemer. The redeemed are for ever "vessels of mercy," prepared beforehand, in order that in them might be "made known the riches of his glory." And the reprobate in like  manner  are  exhibited  as  the  "vessels  of  wrath,"  to  show  his righteous wrath and " make his power known." Rom. ix. 22, 23. It has already been proved, under chapter iv., section 1, that the chief end of God in the original creation was the manifestation of his own glorious perfections. If this was his end in the original creation, it of course must be so in every subsequent step consequent upon it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Immediately upon the close of the judgment, the righteous, being honourably acquitted, are to be awarded admission to the presence of  the  Lord,  with  whom  they  are  ever  to  continue  in  a  state  of conscious  and  exalted  happiness,  excellence,  and  honour,  for  an absolutely unending eternity. Of the blessed estate of the saints, the Scriptures  teach  --  (1.)  Their  blessedness  flows  from  their  perfect freedom  from  sin,  and  from  their  being  with  God  and  Christ,  and their sharing the glory of Christ as joint heirs with him. John xvii. 24;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rom. viii. 17; 1 Thess. iv. 17; Rev. xxi. 3. (2.) It shall be perfectly free from  all  evil  of  every  kind  (Rev.  xxi.  4),  and  it  shall  involve  every form of blessedness in an inconceivably great degree (1 Cor. ii. 9) and exalted  in  kind  (Col.  i.  12).  (3.)  It  is  to  endure  for  an  absolutely unending eternity. It is called " eternal life" and " everlasting life," an " eternal weight of glory," "eternal salvation," an "everlasting kingdom," an "eternal inheritance." Matt. xix. 16, 29; xxv. 46; Rom. ii. 7; 2 Cor. iv. 17; Heb. v. 9; 2 Pet. i. 11; 1 Pet. i. 4; Heb. ix. 15.</p>
<p>From such passages as Rom. viii. 19 -- 23; 2 Pet. iii. 5 -- 13, and Rev. xxi. 1, it appears not improbable that after the great conflagration of the Earth and all that inhabits its surface, which the Scriptures reveal shall accompany the judgment, this world will be reconstituted, and as the "new heaven" and the "new earth" be gloriously adapted to be the permanent residence of Christ and his Church.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The reprobate will be immediately driven to the place prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. xxv. 41); and are there to continue in the  conscious  endurance  of  torment  and  shame  for  an  absolutely unending eternity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The strongest terms which the Greek language affords are employed in the New Testament to express the unending duration of the penal torments of the lost. The same words (aion, aionios, and aidios) are used to express the eternal existence of God (1 Tim. i. 17; Rom. i. 20; xvi. 26), of Christ (Rev. i. 18), of the Holy Ghost (Heb. ix. 14), and the endless  duration  of  the  happiness  of  the  saints  (John  vi.  58;  Matt. xix.  29;  Matt.  xxv.  40,  etc..  etc.),  and  the  endless  duration  of  the sufferings of the lost. Matt. xxv. 46; Jude 6. Besides, their condition is  constantly  set  forth  by  such  terms  as,  the  "fire  that  shall  not  be quenched," "fire unquenchable," "the worm  that never dies," "bottomless  pit,"  the  necessity  of  paying  "the  uttermost  farthing," "the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and ever." Luke iii. 17;  Mark ix.  45,  46;  Rev.  ix.  1;  Matt.  v.  26;  Rev.  xiv.  10,  11.  Of  the unpardonable  sin,  Christ  says  that  it  shall  never  be  pardoned, "neither in this world nor in that which is to come." Matt. xii. 32.</p>
<p>The  entire  Christian  Church,  Greek  and  Roman,  Lutheran  and Reformed, have agreed in holding this truth that the penal sufferings of  the  lost  are  to  last  for  ever.  Certain  individuals  and  heretical societies, however, have denied it, and substituted in its place one or other of the following hypotheses: --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  That  the  "second  death"  spoken  of  in  Rev.  xx.  14,  to  which  the wicked shall be subjected after their condemnation in the judgment, involves  the  total  and  absolute  destruction  of  their  being  --  i.e., annihilation.  But  the  Scriptures  always  consistently  speak  of  the future of the lost as a state of conscious suffering enduring for ever. The "worm dieth not" --" everlasting fire"-- "unquenchable fire" --" weeping  and  gnashing  of  teeth"--"  the  smoke  of  their  torment ascendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night."</li>
<li>(2.)  The  other  hypothesis  supposes  that,  sooner  or  later,  God  will secure  the  repentance  and  consequent  reformation  and  restoration of  all  sinners,  even  of  the  devil  himself.  This  is  to  result  either through  the  atoning  and  purifying  efficacy  of  protracted  though temporary suffering,  or  through  other  moral  influences  which  God will bring to bear upon them in another world. But remember -- (a.) That suffering per se, while it may expiate guilt, has no tendency to purify the soul from pollution or to enkindle spiritual life. (b.) The atonement of Christ and the sanctifying power of his Spirit are the only appointed means of bringing men to repentance, and indeed the highest possible means to that end. In the case of the reprobate these have  been  finally  rejected,  and  hence  "there  remaineth  no  more sacrifice for sins,  but  a  certain  fearful  looking  for  of  judgment  and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries." Heb. x. 26, 27. (c.) There is not the slightest trace in Scripture of such an ultimate restoration, either in the design of it, or the means of it, or the results of  it.  On  the  contrary,  as  we  have  seen,  the  Scriptures  positively affirm the precise reverse to be true.</li>
</ul>
<p>SECTION III. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity:[6] so will he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security,  and  be  always  watchful,  because  they  know  not  at  what hour  the  Lord  will  come;  and  may  be  ever  prepared  to  say,  Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen.[7]</p>
<ol>
<li>II  Peter  3:11,  14;  II  Cor.  5:10-11;  II  Thess.  1:5-7;  Luke  21:27-28;</li>

<p>Rom. 8:22-25 7. Matt. 24:36, 42-44; Mark 13:35-37; Luke 12:35-36; Rev. 22:20</p>
<h2 id="this-section-teaches-_1">This section teaches --<a class="headerlink" href="#this-section-teaches-_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That God has made the fact absolutely certain that there will be a future judgment, in order that this knowledge may act upon all men as  a  wholesome  motive  deterring  them  from  sin;  and,  at  the  same time,  that  it  may  console  the  godly  in  the  midst  of  their  adversity. With reference  to  the  first  object,  Paul  says,  "  We  must  all  appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one  may  receive  the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men."  2  Cor.  v.  10,  11.  And  Peter  says,  "Seeing  then  that  all  these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God? " 2 Pet. iii. 11, 12. With reference to the second object, Paul says, "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you that are troubled  rest  with  us,  when  the  Lord  Jesus  shall  be  revealed  from heaven with his mighty angels." 2 Thess. i.6, 7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That,  on  the  other  hand,  God has left us in absolute  uncertainty with respect to the time at which this great event shall occur; in order to  prevent carnal security, and to keep his people ever on the alert and constantly prepared. That the time is intentionally left unknown is expressly affirmed again and again in Scripture: "But of that day and  that  hour  knoweth  no  man,  no,  not  the  angels  which  are  in heaven, neither the Son, but the, Father." Mark xiii. 32; Matt. xxiv. 36. "Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man cometh at an hour</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>when ye think not." Luke xii. 40. "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power." Acts i. 7. " The day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night." 1Thess. v. 2; 2 Pet. iii.  10.  "Behold,  I  come  as  a  thief.  Blessed  is  he  that  watcheth, and keepeth his garments." Rev. xvi. 15. The designed effect of the attitude of uncertainty with regard to the time of the second advent and  general  judgment  in  which  the  saints  are  placed  is,  that  they should regard it as always immediately impending; that they should look forward to it with solemn awe, and yet with joyful confidence; and hence, in view of it, be incited to the performance of duty and the attainment of holiness, and. comforted in sorrow. Phil. iii. 20; Col. iii. 4, 5; James v. 7. It is their duty also to love, watch, wait for, and hasten unto the coming of our Lord. Luke xii. 35-37; 1 Cor. i. 7, 8; 1 These. i. 9, 10; 2 Tim. iv. 8; 2 Pet. iii. 12; Rev. xxii. 20.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-1">Appendix 1<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Meaning of 'System of Doctrine': Old School vs. New School</p>
<p>In the debates which preceded the reunion of the two branches of the American Presbyterian Church in 1870, Dr. Charles Hodge represented  the  Old  School  branch  in  the  Biblical  Repertory  and Princeton  Review,  and  Dr.  Henry  B.  Smith  represented  the  New School branch in the American Theological Review. It is a significant fact  that,  while  the  discussion  began  in  the  form  of  attack  and defence,  it  resulted  in  the  discovery  that  these  truly  representative men  held  precisely  identical  opinions  as  to  the  historical  meaning and constitutional force of the formula of subscription to which all ministers and elders must assent as the condition of their ordination. In support of this they mutually cite the history and pledge the faith of  their  respective  denominations  pending  the  solemn  covenants implied in reunion.</p>
<p>Dr.  Hodge  discussed  this  subject  and  defined  the  position  of  his branch of the Church in articles printed Oct, 1831, and Oct, 1858, and Jul, 1867. He says:[1] "The two principles which by common consent of all honest men  determine  the interpretation of oaths and professions  of  faith  are,  first,  the  plain,  historical  meaning  of  the words; and secondly, the animus imponentis-that is, the intention of  the  party  imposing  the  oath  or  requiring  the  profession.  The words, therefore, 'system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures,' are to be taken in their plain historical sense." "Again, by the animus imponentis, in the case contemplated, is to be understood, not the mind  or  intention  of  the  ordaining  Presbytery.  It  is  the  mind  or intention of the Church, of which the Presbytery is the organ."</p>
<p>The  question,  however,  is,  What  is  the  true  sense  of  the  phrase "system  of  doctrine"  in  our  ordination  service?  or  what  does  the Church understand the candidate to profess when he says that "he receives  and  adopts  the  Confession  of  Faith  of  this  Church  as containing  the  system  of  doctrine  taught  in  the  Holy  Scripture"? There are three different answers given to that question:</p>
<p>"I.  It  is  said  by  some  that  in  adopting  'the  system  of  doctrine'  the candidate  is  understood  to  adopt  it,  not  in  the  form  or  manner  in which  it  is  presented  in  the  Confession  of  Faith,  but  only  for 'substance of doctrine'-'that by the system contained in the Confession  is  meant  the  essential  doctrines  of  Christianity,  and nothing more.'[2] The objection to this interpretation is that-</p>
<ul>
<li>"(1) It is not the meaning  of the words  employed.  The  two declarations,  'I adopt  the  system  of  doctrine  contained  in  the Confession  of  Faith,'  and  'I  adopt  the  system  for  substance  of doctrine,' are not identical. The one cannot, therefore, be substituted for the other.. . In adopting a system of doctrine the candidate adopts a series of doctrines in the specific form in which they are presented in that system. The phrase 'for substance of doctrine' is ambiguous; the phrase 'system of doctrine' has a definite sense. The system of the Reformed or Calvinistic churches is a known and admitted scheme of doctrine, and that scheme, and nothing more or less, we profess to adopt.</li>
</ul>
<p>"(2)  The  second  objection  to  this  view  is  that  it  is  contrary  to  the mind  of  the  Church.  That  mind,  on  this  point,  is  rendered  clear beyond dispute by her repeated official declarations on the subject. The famous adopting act of the original Synod, passed in AD 1729, is in these words: 'Although the Synod do not claim or pretend to any authority of imposing our faith on other men's consciences, but do profess our just dissatisfaction with and abhorrence of such impositions, and  do utterly disclaim all legislative power  and authority  in  the  Church,  being  willing  to  receive  one  another,  as Christ has received us, to the glory of God, and admit to fellowship in sacred ordinances all such as we have grounds to believe Christ will at  last  admit  to  the  kingdom  of  heaven,-yet  we  are  undoubtedly obliged to take care that the faith once delivered to the saints be kept pure and uncorrupt among us, and so handed down to our posterity; and do therefore agree that all ministers of this Synod shall declare their agreement in and approbation of the Confession of Faith, with the  Larger  and  Shorter  Catechisms  of  the  Assembly  of  Divines  in</p>
<p>Westminster,  as  being,  in  all  the  essentials  and  necessary  articles, good forms of sound words and systems of Christian doctrine, and do also adopt the said Confession and Catechisms as the confession of our  faith.  And  we  do  also  agree  that  all  Presbyteries  within  our bounds  shall  always  take  care  not  to  admit  any  candidate  of  the ministry into the exercise of the sacred functions, but what declares his agreement in opinion with all the essential and necessary articles of said Confession, either by subscribing said Confession  and Catechisms, or by a verbal declaration of their assent thereto, as such minister or candidate shall think best. And in case any minister of this Synod, or any candidate for the ministry, shall have any scruple with respect to any article or articles of said Confession or Catechisms, he shall, at the time of making said declaration, declare his sentiments to the Presbytery or Synod, who shall, notwithstanding, admit him to the exercise of the ministry within our bounds, and to ministerial communion, if the Synod or Presbytery shall  judge  his  scruple  or  mistake  to  be  only  about  articles  not essential or necessary in doctrine, worship, or government. But if the Synod or Presbytery shall judge such ministers or candidate erroneous in essential and necessary articles of faith,  the  Synod  or Presbytery  shall  declare  them  incapable  of  communion  with  them. And the Synod do solemnly agree that none of them will traduce or use  any  opprobrious  terms  of  those  who  differ  from  us  in  extraessential  and  not  necessary  points  of  doctrine,  but  treat  them  with the same friendship, kindness, and brotherly love as if they did not differ in sentiment.'</p>
<p>"On the afternoon of the day on which the above act was adopted, the following minute was recorded-viz.:</p>
<p>"'All  the  ministers  of  this  Synod  now  present,  except  one,  that declared himself not prepared, ... after proposing all the scruples that any of them had to make against any articles and expressions in the Confession  of  Faith  and  Larger  and  Shorter  Catechisms  of  the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, have unanimously agreed in the solution of those scruples, and in declaring the said Confession and</p>
<p>Catechisms to be the confession of their faith, excepting only some clauses  in  the  twentieth  [WCF  20]  and  twenty-third  [WCF  23] chapters,  concerning  which  clauses  the  Synod  do  unanimously declare  that  they  do  not  receive  those  articles  in  such  sense  as  to suppose  that  the  civil  magistrate  hath  a  controlling  power  over Synods with respect to the exercise of their ministerial authority or power to persecute any for their religion, or in any sense contrary to the Protestant succession to the throne of Great Britain.</p>
<p>"'The  Synod,  observing  that  unanimity,  peace,  and  unity  which appeared  in  all  their  consultations  relating  to  the  affair  of  the Confession, did unanimously agree in giving thanks to God in solemn prayer and praises.'</p>
<p>"This  important  document  teaches,  first,  that  in  our  Church  the terms  of  Christian  communion  are  competent  knowledge  and  a credible profession of faith and repentance; second, that the condition of ministerial communion is the adoption of the system of doctrine  contained  in  the  Westminster  Confession  of  Faith  and Catechisms; third, that the only exceptions allowed to be taken were such as related to matters outside that system of doctrine, and the rejection of which left that system in its integrity.</p>
<p>"In AD 1730 the Synod declared 'that they understand those clauses that respect the admission of intrants or candidates in such sense as to oblige them to receive and adopt the Confession and Catechisms at their admission, in the same manner, and as fully as the members of the Synod did, who were then present.' In AD 1736 the Synod again says: 'The Synod has adopted, and still do adhere to, the Westminster  Confession  and  Catechisms  and  Directory,  without variation or alteration; ... and they further declare that this was our meaning and true intent in our first adopting of said Confession.'</p>
<p>"When the two Synods (Old Light and New Light) were reunited in AD 1758, the first article of the terms of union was as follows: 'Both Synods  having  always  approved  and  received  the  Westminster</p>
<p>Confession,  Larger  and  Shorter  Catechisms,  as  an  orthodox  and excellent system of doctrine, founded on the Word of God, we do still receive the same as the confession of our faith, and also adhere to the plan  of  worship  and  government  and  discipline  contained  in  the Westminster Directory, strictly enjoining it on all our ministers and probationers for the ministry that they preach and teach according to the form of sound words in the said Confession and Catechisms, and avoid and oppose all errors contrary thereto.'</p>
<ul>
<li>"(3) The third argument against this interpretation of the ordination formula  is  that  the  phrase  'substance  of  doctrine'  has  no  definite assignable meaning.</li>
<li>"(4) The fourth argument against it is that this system has been tried and found to produce the greatest disorder and confusion.</li>
<li>"II. The second interpretation of the question presented at ordination  is  that  the  person  who  answers  that  question  in  the affirmative does thereby profess to receive and adopt every proposition contained in that Confession as a part of his own faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>"The objections to this view are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"(1) It is contrary to the plain historical meaning of the words.</li>
<li>"(2) It is contrary to the animus imponentis, or mind of the Church." [This  also  Dr.  Hodge  proves  by  the  history  of  the  events  attending the original adoption of the Confession.]</li>
<li>"(3) This principle is impracticable. It cannot be carried out without working the certain and immediate  ruin of the Church. Our Confession is a large book; besides the system of doctrine common to all Reformed churches, it contains deliverances on many other topics relating to Church and State and to our social relations.</li>
<li>"(4)  The  office  of  the  Church  is  purely  ministerial,  and  should  be exercised  cautiously  and  humbly.  She  has  no  more  right  unduly  to</li>
</ul>
<p>lower  or  to  raise  unduly  the  evidence  which  she  demands  of  a vocation to the ministry than she has to alter the evidence of a call to grace and salvation.</p>
<ul>
<li>"(5)  There  is  another  great  evil  connected  with  these  inordinate demands. To adopt every proposition contained in the Westminster Confession  and  Catechisms  is  more  than  the  vast  majority  of  our ministers either do or can do. To make them profess to do it is a great sin.  It  hurts  their  conscience.  It  fosters  a  spirit  of  evasion  and subterfuge.</li>
<li>"III. The  third  interpretation  of  the  formula  prescribed  for  the adoption  of  the  Confession  of  Faith  is  the  true  via  media.  The Westminster Confession contains three distinct classes of doctrines: first,  those  common to all  Christians;  second,  those  common to all Protestants,  and  by  which  they  are  distinguished  from  Romanists; thirdly, those which are peculiar to the Reformed churches, by which they are distinguished on the one hand from Lutherans, and on the other from the Arminians and other sects of later historical origin." [All  these  classes  of  doctrines  we  profess  to  believe,  as  far  as  they constitute  a  "system  of  doctrine"-i.e.  we  profess  to  be  Christians; more  definitely, to be Protestants; more  definitely yet, to be Calvinists.]</li>
<li>"(1) The  first argument  in  favor  of this interpretation of our ordination service is that it is in accordance with the literal meaning of the words; (2) that it corresponds with the known intention of the Church in requiring the adoption of the Confession" [this Dr. Hodge had already proved to be the fact by historical evidence]; "(3) it is the only interpretation consistent with a good conscience, and with the peace and union of the Church."</li>
</ul>
<p>In  the  October  number  of  the  American  Theological  Review,  AD 1867, Dr. Henry B. Smith says:</p>
<p>"No declaration of the New School as a body, nor of those considered as its representatives, could be, or was, cited in favor of such a loose phrase as 'substance of doctrine,'  and  by  many  New  School  men  it was  publicly  and  definitely  denied.  We  agreed  to  the  'system-ofdoctrine' view, and agreed, also, in condemning the 'everyproposition  theory'  as  inconsistent  with  the  plain  terms  of  the adopting  act,  and  with  the  uniform  practice  of  the  Presbyterian Church. We disallow the phrase 'substance of doctrine,' because it is indefinite,  easily  misunderstood,  and  does  not  suggest  the  right theory. That right theory is found in a simple and honest interpretation of the ordination formula-that we receive the Confession  of  Faith  as  containing  the  system  of  doctrine  taught  in the Holy Scriptures. This declares that the system of the Confession is  the  system  taught  in  the  Bible.  The  system  of  the  Confession,  as everybody knows, is the Reformed or Calvinistic system, in distinction  from  the  Lutheran,  or  Arminian,  the  Antinomian,  the Pelagian  and  the  Roman  Catholic.  No  one  can  honestly  and  fairly subscribe  the  Confession  who  does  not  accept  the  Reformed  or Calvinistic system. This is the plain sense of the adopting act of AD 1729. Everybody knows  that the 'fair historical' sense of the Confession is plainly and resolutely Calvinistic.</p>
<p>"On this capital point of assent to the Confession, then, we conclude that there is no real difference between the Old School and the New. We are both willing to accept it as containing the Reformed system of doctrine.  We  cordially  agree-and  so,  we  are  convinced,  would  our whole New School ministry and eldership-to the statement of this theory as given in the Princeton Review. Among honest and candid men  there  is  really  no  doubt  or  question  as  to  what  subscription implies."</p>

<p>The Auburn Declaration and The Declaratory Act</p>
<p>"The Auburn Declaration" Adopted by a Representative Body of New School Presbyterians in AD  1837, and "The Declaratory Act," Adopted by the United Presbyterian Synod of Scotland, AD 1879.</p>
<p>The  abovementioned  declaratory  acts  are  the  only  two  historical papers authoritatively interpreting the sense in which the Westminster Confession of Faith is accepted by large branches of the Presbyterian  Church.  Their  historical  and  interpretative  value  is obvious,  but  they  are  especially  valuable  as  demonstrating  the fidelity  with  which  the  Presbyterian  churches  on  both  sides  of  the ocean adhere to the original type of Reformed theology, and hence their essential unity in spite of their organic differences.</p>

Baxter Dickinson, D.D.,  was  issued  by  an  important  representative  convention  of Presbyterian  ministers  adhering  to  the  New  School  branch,  at Auburn,  New  York,  Aug,  1837.  It  is,  therefore,  an  authoritative explanation of the interpretation given to the Westminster Confession by the leading minds of the New School at the era of its organization  as  a  distinct  denomination.  The  Old  School  General Assembly  in  Albany,  AD  1868,  in  resolutions  looking  to  reunion, endorsed the "Auburn Declaration" as containing "all the fundamentals of the Calvinistic Creed."</p>

<h2 id="ii-the-declaratory-act">II. The Declaratory Act.<a class="headerlink" href="#ii-the-declaratory-act" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The United Presbyterian Church of Scotland was formed in 1847 by a union of  the  United  Associate  Synod  of  the  Secession  Church  with the Synod of the Relief Church. In the doctrinal basis of this union it was  declared  "that  the  Westminster  Confession  of  Faith  and  the Larger and Shorter Catechisms are the Confession and Catechisms of this  Church,  and  contain  the  authorized  exhibition  of  the  sense  in which we understand the Holy Scriptures."</p>
<p>In order to explain the above basis the following Declaratory Act as to the sense in which the Confession is to be understood was passed by the Synod in May, 1879:</p>
<p>"Whereas, The formula in which the Subordinate[1] Standards of this Church are accepted requires assent to them as an exhibition of the sense  in  which  the  Scriptures  are  understood;  Whereas,  These Standards,  being  of  human  composition,  are  necessarily  imperfect, and the  Church  has  already  allowed  exception  to  be  taken  to  their teaching  or  supposed  teaching  on  one  important  subject;[2]  And Whereas,  There  are  other  subjects  in  regard  to  which  it  has  been found desirable to set forth more fully and clearly the view which the Synod  takes  of  the  Holy  Scripture;  Therefore,  the  Synod  hereby declares as follows:</p>
<p>"1.  That  in  regard  to  the  doctrine  of  redemption  as  taught  in  the Standards,  and  in  consistency  therewith,  the  love  of  God  to  all mankind, his gift of his Son to be the propitiation for the sins of the whole  world, and  the free offer of salvation to men  without distinction  on  the  ground  of  Christ's  perfect  sacrifice,  are  matters which have been and continue to be regarded by this Church as vital to  the  system  of  gospel  truth,  and  to  which  due  prominence  ought ever to be given.</p>
<p>"2.  That  the  doctrine  of  divine  decrees,  including  the  doctrine  of election to eternal life, is held in connection and harmony with the truth  that  God  is  not  willing  that  any  should  perish,  but  that  all should  come  to  repentance, that he has provided  a salvation sufficient for all, adapted to all and offered to all in the gospel; and also with the responsibility of every man for his dealing with the free and unrestricted offer of eternal life.</p>
<p>"3.  That the doctrine of man's total depravity, and of his loss of all ability  of  will  to  any  spiritual  good  accompanying  salvation,  is  not held as implying such a condition of man's nature as would affect his responsibility under the law of God and the gospel of Christ, or that he does not experience the striving and restraining.</p>
<p>influences of the Spirit of God, or that he cannot perform actions in any  sense  good;  although  actions  which  do  not  spring  from  a renewed heart are not spiritually good or holy-such as accompany salvation.</p>
<p>"4.  That  while  none  are  saved  except  through  the  mediation  of Christ, and by the grace of his Holy Spirit, who worketh when and where and how it pleaseth him; while the duty of sending the gospel to the heathen, who are sunk in ignorance, sin, and misery, is clear and  imperative;  and  while  the  outward  and  ordinary  means  of salvation for those capable of being outwardly called by the word are the  ordinances  of  the  gospel,  in  accepting  the  Standards,  it  is  not required to be held that any who die in infancy are lost, or that God may  not  extend  his  grace  to  any  who  are  without  the  pale  of  the ordinary means, as it may seem good in his sight.</p>
<ul>
<li>"5.  That  in  regard  to  the  doctrine  of  the  civil  magistrate,  and  his authority  and  duty  in  the  sphere  of  religion,  as  taught  in  the Standards,[3] this Church holds that the Lord Jesus Christ is the only King  and  Head  of  the  Church,  and  'Head  over  all  things  to  the Church, which is his body,' disapproves all compulsory or persecuting  and  intolerant  principles  in  religion;  and  declares,  as hitherto,  that  she  does  not  require  approval  of  anything  in  her Standards that teaches, or may be supposed to teach, such principles.</li>
<li>"6.  That  Christ  has  laid  it  as  a  permanent  and  universal  obligation upon  his  Church  at  once  to  maintain  her  own  ordinances  and  to 'preach  the  gospel  to  every  creature;'  and  has  ordained  that  his people  provide  by  their  freewill  offerings  for  the  fulfillment  of  this obligation.</li>
<li>"7.  That,  in  accordance  with  the  practice  hitherto  observed  in  this Church, liberty of opinion is allowed on such points in the Standards, not entering into the substance of the faith, as the interpretation of the 'six days' in the Mosaic account of creation: the Church guarding against the abuse of this liberty to the injury of its unity and peace."</li>

<p>WHAT IS PRESBYTERIANISM? by Charles Hodge</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>BRETHREN:-We  are  assembled  this  evening  as  a  Presbyterian Historical  Society.  It  has  occurred  to  me  that  it  would  not  be inappropriate to discuss the question, What is Presbyterianism? You will not expect from me an oration. My object is neither conviction nor persuasion; but exposition. I propose to occupy the hour devoted to this address in an attempt to unfold the principles of that system of Church polity which we, as Presbyterians, hold to be laid down in the word of God.</p>
<p>Setting aside Erastianism, which teaches that the Church is only one form  of  the  State;  and  Quakerism,  which  does  not  provide  for  the external  organization  of  the  Church,  there  are  only  four  radically different theories on the subject of Church Polity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The  Popish  theory,  which  assumes  that  Christ,  the  Apostles  and believers,  constituted  the  Church  while  our  Saviour  was  on  earth, and  this  organization  was  designed  to  be  perpetual.  After  the ascension of our Lord, Peter became his Vicar, and took his place as the visible head of the Church. This primacy of Peter, as the universal Bishop, is continued in his successors, the Bishops of Rome; and the apostleship  is perpetuated  in  the  order  of  Prelates.  As  in the Primitive Church, no one could be an apostle who was not subject to Christ, so now no one can be a Prelate who is not subject to the Pope. And  as  then  no  one  could  be  a  Christian  who  was  not  subject  to Christ and the apostles, so now no one can be a Christian who is not subject to the Pope and the Prelates. This is the Romish theory of the Church. A  Vicar  of  Christ,  a  perpetual  College  of  apostles,  and  the people subject to their infallible control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Prelatical theory assumes the perpetuity of the apostleship as the governing power in the Church, which therefore consists of those who  profess  the  true  religion,  and  are  subject  to  apostle-bishops. This is the Anglican or High-Church form of this theory. In its LowChurch  form,  the  Prelatical  theory  simply  teaches  that  there  was originally a three-fold order in the ministry, and that there should be now. But it does not affirm that mode of organization to be essential.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Independent or Congregational theory includes two principles;  first,  that  the  governing  and  executive  power  in  the Church  is  in the brotherhood;  and  secondly,  that  the  Church organization  is  complete  in  each  worshipping  assembly,  which  is independent of every other.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  fourth  theory  is  the  Presbyterian,  which  it  is  our  present business to attempt to unfold. The three great negations of Presbyterianism-that is, the three great errors which it denies are1.  That  all  church  power  vests  in  the  clergy.  2.  That  the  apostolic office is perpetual. 3. That each individual Christian congregation is independent.  The  affirmative  statement  of  these  principles  is-1. That the people have a right to a substantive part in the government of the Church.  2.  That  presbyters,  who  minister  in  word  and doctrine,  are  the  highest  permanent  officers  of  the  Church,  and  all belong to the same order. 3. That the outward and visible Church is, or  should  be,  one,  in  the  sense  that  a  smaller  part  is  subject  to  a larger,  and  a  larger  to  the  whole.  It  is  not  holding  one  of  these principles that makes a man a Presbyterian, but his holding them all.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I. The first of these principles relates to the power and rights of the people. As to the nature of Church power, it is to be remembered that the  Church  is  a  theocracy.  Jesus  Christ  is  its  head.  All  power  is derived from him. His word is our written constitution. All  Church power is, therefore, properly ministerial and administrative. Everything is  to  be  done  in  the  name  of  Christ,  and  in  accordance with his directions. The Church, however, is a self-governing society, distinct from the State, having its officers and laws, and, therefore,</li>
</ol>
<p>an administrative government of its own. The power of the Church relates,  1.  To  matters  of  doctrine.  She  had  the  right  to  set  forth  a public declaration of the truths which she believes, and which are to be acknowledged by all who enter her communion. That is, she has the right to frame creeds or confessions of faith, as her testimony for the  truth,  and  her  protest  against  error.  And  as  she  has  been commissioned  to  teach  all  nations,  she  has  the  right  of  selecting teachers,  of  judging  their  fitness,  of  ordaining  and  sending  them forth  into  the  field,  and  of  recalling  and  deposing  them  when unfaithful.  2.  The  Church  has  power  to  set  down  rules  for  the ordering of public worship. 3. She has power to make rules for her own government; such as every Church has in its Book of Discipline, Constitution,  or  Canons,  &amp;c.  4.  She  has  power  to  receive  into fellowship, and to exclude the unworthy from her own communion.</p>
<p>Now,  the  question  is,  Where  does  this  power  vest?  Does  it,  as Romanists  and  Prelatists  affirm,  belong  exclusively  to  the  clergy? Have  they  the  right  to  determine  for  the  Church  what  she  is  to believe, what she is to profess, what she is to do, and whom she is to receive as members, and whom she is to reject? Or does this power vest in the Church itself-that is, in the whole body of the faithful? This,  it  will  be  perceived,  is  a  radical  question-one  which  touches the  essence  of  things,  and  determines  the  destiny  of  men.  If  all Church  power  vests  in  the  clergy,  then  the  people  are  practically bound to passive obedience in all matters of faith and practice; for all right  of  private  judgment  is  then  denied.  If  it  vests  in  the  whole Church,  then  the  people  have  a  right  to  a  substantive  part  in  the decision  of  all  questions  relating  to  doctrine,  worship,  order,  and discipline. The public assertion of this right of the people, at the time of the Reformation,  roused  all Europe.  It was  an  apocalyptic trumpet,  i.e.  a  trumpet  of  revelation,  tuba  per  sepulchra  sonans, calling  dead  souls  to  life;  awakening  them  to  the  consciousness  of power  and  of  right;  of  power  conveying  right,  and  imposing  the obligation  to  assert  and  exercise  it.  This  was  the  end  of  Church tyranny in all truly Protestant countries. It was the end of the theory that the people were bound to passive submission in matters of faith and practice. It was deliverance to the captive, the opening of  the  prison  to  those  who  were  bound;  the  introduction  of  the people of God into the liberty wherewith Christ has made them free. This  is  the  reason  why  civil  liberty  follows  religious  liberty.  The theory that all Church power vests in a divinely constituted hierarchy, begets the theory that all civil power vests, of divine right, in kings and nobles. And the theory that Church power vests in the Church itself, and all Church officers are servants of the Church, of necessity begets the theory that civil power vests in the people, and that civil magistrates are servants of the people. These theories God has  joined  together,  and  no  man  can  put  them  asunder.  It  was, therefore, by an infallible instinct, the unfortunate Charles of England said, "No bishop, no king;" by which he meant that if there is no despotic power in the Church, there can be no despotic power in the State; or, if there be liberty in the Church, there will be liberty in the State.</p>
<p>But  this  great  Protestant  and  Presbyterian  principle  is  not  only  a principle  of  liberty,  it  is  also  a  principle  of  order.  1st.  Because  this power of the people is subject to the infallible authority of the word; and 2d. Because the exercise of it is in the hands of duly constituted officers.  Presbyterianism  does  not  dissolve  the  bands  of  authority, and  resolve  the  Church  into  a  mob.  Though  delivered  from  the autocratic  authority  of  the  hierarchy,  it  remains  under  the  law  to Christ. It is restricted in the exercise of its power by the word of God, which bends the reason, heart, and conscience. We only cease to be the  servants  of  men,  that  we  may  be  the  servants  of  God.  We  are raised  into  a  higher  sphere,  where  perfect  liberty  is  merged  in absolute subjection. As the Church is the aggregate of believers, there is  an  intimate  analogy  between  the  experience  of  the  individual believer, and of the Church as a whole. The believer ceases to be the servant  of  sin,  that  he  may  be  the  servant  of  righteousness;  he  is redeemed from the law, that he may be the servant of Christ. So the Church is delivered from an illegitimate authority, not that she may be  lawless,  but  subject  to  an  authority  legitimate  and  divine.  The Reformers,  therefore,  as instruments  in  the  hands  of  God,  in delivering  the  Church  from  bondage  to  prelates,  did  not  make  it  a tumultuous multitude, in which every man was a law to himself, free to  believe,  and  free  to  do  what  he  pleased.  The  Church,  in  all  the exercise  of  her  power,  in  reference  either  to  doctrine  or  discipline, acts under the written law of God, as recorded in his word.</p>
<p>But besides this, the power of the Church is not only thus limited and guided  by  the  Scriptures,  but  the  exercise  of  it  is  in  the  hands  of legitimate  officers.  The  Church  is  not  a  vast  democracy,  where everything is decided by the popular voice. "God is not the author of confusion,  but  of  peace,  (i.e.  of  order)  as  in  all  churches  of  the saints." The  Westminster  Confession, therefore, expressing the common sentiment of Presbyterians, says-"The Lord Jesus Christ, as King and Head  of his Church, hath therein appointed a government in the hands of Church officers, distinct from the civil magistrate." The doctrine that all civil power vests ultimately in the people, is not inconsistent with the doctrine that that power is in the hands of legitimate officers, legislative, judicial, and executive, to be exercised by them according to law. Nor is it inconsistent with the doctrine that the authority of the civil magistrate is jure divino. So the  doctrine  that  Church  power  vests  in  the  Church  itself,  is  not inconsistent with the doctrine that there is a divinely appointed class of  officers,  through  whom  that  power  is  to  be  exercised.  It  thus appears  that  the  principle  of  liberty  and  the  principle  of  order  are perfectly harmonious.  In  denying  that  all Church  power  vests exclusively in the clergy, whom the people have nothing to do but to believe and to obey, and in affirming that it vests in the Church itself, while we assert the great principle of Christian liberty, we assert the no less important principle of evangelical order.</p>
<p>It  is  not  necessary  to  occupy  your  time  in  quoting  either  from  the Reformed  Confessions  or  from  standard  Presbyterian  writers,  that the principle just stated is one of the radical principles of our system. It is enough to advert to the recognition of it involved in the office of ruling elder.</p>
<p>Ruling  elders  are  declared  to  be  the  representatives  of  the  people. They are chosen by them to act in their name in the government of the Church. The functions of these elders, therefore, determine the power of the people; for a representative is one chosen by others to do in their name what they are entitled to do in their own persons; or rather  to  exercise  the  powers  which  radically  inhere  in  those  for whom they act. The members of a State Legislature, or of Congress, for  example,  can  exercise  only  those  powers  which  are  inherent  in the people.</p>
<p>The  powers,  therefore,  exercised  by  our  ruling  elders,  are  powers which belong to the lay members of the Church. What then are the powers of our ruling elders? 1. As to matters of doctrine and the great office  of  teaching,  they  have  an  equal  voice  with  the  clergy  in  the formation  and  adoption  of all symbols  of faith. According  to Presbyterianism,  it  is  not  competent  for  the  clergy  to  frame  and authoritatively set forth a creed to be embraced by the Church, and to be made a condition of either ministerial or Christian communion, without the consent of the people. Such creeds profess to express the mind  of  the  Church.  But  the  ministry  are  not  the  Church,  and, therefore,  cannot  declare  the  faith  of  the  Church,  without  the cooperation of the Church itself. Such Confessions, at the time of the Reformation, proceeded from the whole Church. And all the Confessions now in authority in the different branches of the great Presbyterian  family,  were  adopted  by  the  people  through  their representatives,  as  the  expression  of  their  faith.  So,  too,  in  the selection of preachers of the word, in judging of their fitness for the sacred office, in deciding whether they shall be ordained, in judging them when arraigned for heresy, the people have, in fact, an equal vote with the clergy.[1]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The same thing is true as to the jus liturgicum, as it is called, of the Church. The ministry cannot frame a ritual, or liturgy, or directory for  public  worship,  and  enjoin  its  use  on  the  people  to  whom  they preach.  All  such  regulations  are  of  force  only  so  far  as  the  people themselves,  in  conjunction  with  their  ministers,  see  fit  to  sanction and adopt them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>So too, in forming a constitution, or in enacting rules of procedure, or  making  canons,  the  people  do  not  merely  passively  assent,  but actively cooperate. They  have, in all these matters, the same authority as the clergy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>And finally,  in  the  exercise  of  the  power  of  the  keys,  in  opening and shutting the door of the communion with the Church, the people have a decisive voice. In all cases of discipline, they are called upon to judge and to decide.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There can, therefore, be no doubt that Presbyterians do carry out the principle that Church power vests in the Church itself, and that the people  have  a  right  to  a  substantive  part  in  its  discipline  and government. In other words, we do not hold that all power vests in the clergy, and that the people have only to listen and obey.</p>
<p>But  is  this  a  scriptural  principle?  Is  it  a  matter  of  concession  and courtesy, or is it a matter of divine right? Is our office of ruling elder only one of expediency, or is it an essential element of  our  system,  arising  out  of  the  very  nature  of  the  Church  as constituted by God, and, therefore, of divine authority?</p>
<p>This, in the last resort, is,  after  all,  only  the  question,  Whether  the clergy are the Church, or whether the people are the Church. If,  as Louis  the  XIV  said  of  France,  "I  am  the  State,"  the  clergy  can  say, "We are the Church," then all Church power vests in them, as all civil power vested in the French monarch. But if the people are the State, civil  power  vests  in  them;  and  if  the  people  are  the  Church,  power vests  in  the  people.  If  the  clergy  are  priests  and  mediators,  the channel of all divine communications, and the only medium of access to God, then all power is in their hands; but if all believers are priests and  kings,  then  they  have  something  more  to  do  than  merely passively to submit. So abhorrent is this idea of the clergy being the</p>
<p>Church to the consciousness of Christians, that no definition of the Church  for  the  first  fifteen  centuries  after  Christ,  was  ever  framed that even mentioned the clergy. This is said to have been first done by  Canisius  and  Bellarmine.[2]  Romanists  define  the  Church  to  be "those  who  profess  the  true  religion,  and  are  subject  to  the  Pope." Anglicans define it as "those who profess the true religion, and are subject to Prelates." The Westminster Confession defines the visible Church,  "Those  who  profess  the  true  religion,  together  with  their children."  In  every  Protestant  symbol,  Lutheran  or  Reformed,  the Church  is  said  to  be  the  company  of  faithful  men.  Now,  as  a definition is the statement of the essential attributes or characteristics  of  a  subject;  and  as,  by  the  common  consent  of Protestants,  the  definition  of  the  Church  is  complete  without  even mentioning the clergy, it is evidently the renunciation of the radical principles  of  Protestantism,  and,  of  course,  of  Presbyterianism,  to maintain  that  all Church  power  vests  in  the  clergy. The  first argument, therefore, in support of the doctrine that the people have a right to a substantive part in the government of the Church is derived from the fact that they, according to the Scriptures and all Protestant Confessions, constitute the Church.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A  second  argument  is  this.  All  Church  power  arises  from  the indwelling of the Spirit; therefore those in whom the Spirit dwells are the seat of Church power. But the Spirit dwells in the whole Church, and therefore the whole Church is the seat of Church power.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first  member of  this  syllogism  is  not  disputed.  The  ground  on which Romanists hold that Church power vests in the bishops, to the exclusion of the people, is that they hold that the Spirit was promised and  given  to  the  bishops  as  a  class.  When  Christ  breathed  on  his disciples, and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained;" and when he said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth  shall  be  bound  in  heaven;  and  whatsoever  ye  shall  loose  on earth shall be loosed in heaven; and when he further said, "He that heareth you heareth me; and lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world;" they hold that he gave the Holy Ghost to the apostles and to their successors in the apostleship, to continue unto the end of the world, to guide them into the knowledge of the truth, and to constitute them the authoritative teachers and rulers of the Church. If  this  is  true,  then,  of  course,  all  Church  power  vests  in  these apostle-bishops.  But  on  the  other  hand,  if  it  is  true  that  the  Spirit dwells  in  the  whole  Church;  if  he  guides  the  people  as  well  as  the clergy into the knowledge of the truth; if he animates the whole body, and makes it the representative of Christ on earth so that they who hear the Church hear Christ, and so that what the Church binds on earth is bound in heaven, then, of course, Church power vests in the Church itself, and not exclusively in the clergy.[3]</p>
<p>If there be anything  plain  from  the  whole  tenor  of  the  New Testament, and from innumerable explicit declarations of the word of God, it is that the Spirit dwells in the whole body of Christ; that he guides  all  his  people  into  the  knowledge  of  the  truth;  that  every believer is taught of God, and has the witness in himself, and has no need that any should teach him, but the anointing which abideth in him  teacheth  him  all  things.  It  is,  therefore,  the  teaching  of  the Church, and not of the clergy exclusively, which is ministerially the teaching  of  the  Spirit,  and  the  judgment  of  the  Spirit.  It  is  a thoroughly  anti-christian doctrine that the Spirit of God,  and therefore the life and governing power of the Church, resides in the ministry, to the exclusion of the people.</p>
<p>When  the  great  promise  of  the  Spirit  was  fulfilled  on  the  day  of Pentecost, it was fulfilled not in reference to the apostles only. It was of the whole assembly it was said, "They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave  them  utterance."  Paul,  in  writing  to  the  Romans,  says,  "We being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.  Having,  therefore,  gifts  differing  according  to  the  grace given  unto  us,  whether  prophecy,  let  us  prophesy  according  to  the proportion of faith; or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he that  teacheth,  on  teaching."  To  the  Corinthians  he  says:  "To  every one is given a manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal. To one is given  by  the  Spirit  the  word  of  wisdom,  to  another  the  word  of knowledge by the same Spirit." To the Ephesians he says: "There is one body and one Spirit; but unto every one is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ." This is the uniform representation of Scripture. The Spirit dwells in the whole Church, animates, guides, and instructs the whole. If, therefore, it be true, as all admit, that Church power goes with the Spirit, and arises out of his presence, it cannot belong exclusively to the clergy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The third argument on this subject is derived from the commission given by Christ to his Church, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end  of  the  world."  This  commission  imposes  a  certain  duty;  it conveys certain powers; and it includes a great promise. The duty is to  spread  and  to  maintain  the  gospel  in  its  purity  over  the  whole earth. The powers are those required for the accomplishment of that object, i.e. the power to teach, to rule, and to exercise discipline. And the  promise  is  the  assurance  of  Christ's  perpetual  presence  and assistance. As neither the duty to extend and sustain the gospel in its purity, nor the promise of Christ's presence is peculiar to the apostles as  a  class,  or  to  the  clergy  as  a  body,  but  as  both  the  duty  and  the promise  belong  to  the  whole  Church,  so  also  of  necessity  do  the powers of the possession of which the obligation rests. The command,  "Go  teach  all  nations,"  "go  preach  the  gospel  to  every creature," falls on the ear of the whole Church. It wakens a thrill in every heart. Every Christian feels that the command is addressed to a body of which he is a member, and that he has a personal obligation to discharge. It was not the ministry alone to whom this commission was  given,  and  therefore  it  is  not  to  them  alone  that  the  powers which it conveys belong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right of the people to a substantive part in the government of the  Church  is  recognized  and  sanctioned  by  the  apostles  in  almost every conceivable way. When they thought it necessary to complete the college of apostles, after the apostasy of Judas, Peter, addressing the disciples, the number being an hundred and twenty, said, "Men and brethren, of these men which have companied with us, all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John unto that same day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection." And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and  Matthias.  And  they  prayed  and  cast  lots,  and  the  lot  fell  on Matthias, and he was numbered with the apostles." Thus in this most important initiatory step, the people had a decisive voice. So, when deacons were to be appointed, the whole multitude chose the seven men  who  were  to  be  invested  with  the  office.  When  the  question arose as to the continued obligation of the Mosaic law, the authoritative decision proceeded from the whole Church. "It pleased," says the sacred historian, "the apostles and elders, with the whole  Church,  to  send  chosen  men  of  their  own  company  to Antioch."  And  they  wrote  letters  by  them  after  this  manner:  "The apostles,  elders,  and  brethren,  (oi<code>avpo,stoloi  kai.  oi</code>  presbu,teroi kai.  oi`  avdeljoi,)  send  greeting  unto  the  brethren  which  are  of  the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia." The brethren, therefore, were  associated  with  the  ministry  in  the  decision  of  this  great doctrinal  and  practical  question.  Most  of  the  apostolic  epistles  are addressed  to  churches,  i.e.  the  saints  or  believers, of Corinth, Ephesus,  Galatia,  and  Philippi.  In  these  epistles,  the  people  are assumed to be responsible for the orthodoxy of their teachers and for the purity of church members.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They are required not to believe every spirit, but to try the spirits; to sit in judgment on the question whether those who came to them as religious teachers were really sent of God. The Galatians are severely censured  for  giving  heed  to  false  doctrines,  and  are  called  to pronounce even an apostle anathema, if he preached another gospel. The Corinthians are censured for allowing an incestuous person to remain in their communion; they are commanded to excommunicate him,  and  afterwards,  on  his  repentance,  to  restore  him  to  their fellowship. These and other cases of the kind determine nothing as to the  way  in  which  the  power  of  the  people  was  exercised;  but  they prove conclusively that such power existed. The command to watch over the orthodoxy of ministers and the purity of members, was not addressed  exclusively  to  the  clergy,  but  to  the  whole  Church.  We believe that, as in the Synogogue, and in every well ordered society, the powers inherent in the society are exercised through appropriate organs.  But  the  fact  that  these  commands  are  addressed  to  the people,  or  to  the  whole  Church,  proves  that  they  were  responsible, and  that  they  had  a  substantive  part  in  the  government  of  the Church.  It would  be  absurd  in other nations to address any complaints  or  exhortations  to  the  people  of  Russia  in  reference  to national  affairs,  because  they  have  no  part  in  the  government.  It would  be  no  less  absurd  to  address  Roman  Catholics  as  a  selfgoverning body. But such addresses may well be made by the people of one of our States to the people of another, because the people have the power, though it is exercised through legitimate organs. While, therefore, the epistles of the apostles do not prove that the churches whom  they  addressed  had  not  regular  officers  through  whom  the power of the Church was to be exercised, they abundantly prove that such  power  vested  in  the  people;  that  they  had  a  right  and  were bound to</p>
<p>take part in the government of the Church, and in the preservation of its purity.</p>
<p>It was only gradually, through a course of ages, that the power thus pertaining to the people was absorbed by the clergy. The progress of this absorption kept pace with the corruption of the Church, until the entire domination of the hierarchy was finally established. The first great  principle,  then,  of  Presbyterianism  is  the  re-assertion  of  the primitive doctrine that Church power belongs to the whole Church; that that power is exercised through legitimate officers, and therefore that the office of ruling elders as the representatives of the people, is not a matter of expediency, but an essential element of our system, arising out of the nature of the Church, and resting on the authority of Christ.</p>
<p>II. The second great principle of Presbyterianism is, that presbyters who  minister  in  word  and  doctrine  are  the  highest  permanent officers of the Church.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Our  first  remark  on  this  subject  is  that  the  ministry  is  an  office, and not merely a work. An office is a station to which the incumbent must  be  appointed,  which  implies  certain  prerogatives,  which  it  is the duty of those concerned to recognize and submit to. A work, on the other hand, is something which any man who has the ability may undertake. This is an obvious distinction. It is not every man who has the qualifications for a Governor of a State, who has the right to act as such. He must be regularly appointed to the post. So it is not every one who has the qualifications for the work of the ministry, who can assume the office of the ministry. He must be regularly appointed. This is plain; (a) From the titles given to ministers in the Scriptures, which  imply  official  station.  (b)  From  their  qualifications  being specified  in  the  word  of  God,  and  the  mode  of  judging  of  those qualifications  being  prescribed.  (c)  From  the  express  command  to appoint  to  the  office  only  such  as,  on  due  examination,  are  found competent. (d) From the record of such appointment in the word of God.  (e) From  the  official authority ascribed to them  in the Scriptures,  and  the  command  that  such  authority  should  be  duly recognized. We need not further argue this point, as it is not denied, except  by  the  Quakers,  and  a  few  such  writers  as  Neander,  who ignore all distinction between the clergy and laity, except what arises from diversity of gifts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Our second remark is, that the office is of divine appointment, not merely in the sense in which the civil powers are ordained of God, but in the sense that ministers derive their authority from Christ, and not from the people. Christ has not only ordained that there shall be such  officers  in  his  Church-he  has  not  only  specified  their  duties and prerogatives-but he gives the requisite qualifications, and calls those  thus  qualified,  and  by  that  call  gives  them  their  official authority.  The  function  of  the  Church  in  the  premises,  is  not  to confer the office, but to sit in judgment on the question, whether the</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>candidate is called of God; and if satisfied on that point, to express its judgment  in  the public and  solemn  manner  prescribed  in Scripture.</p>
<p>That ministers do thus derive their authority from Christ, follows not merely  from  the  theocratical  character  of  the  Church,  and  the relation  which  Christ,  its  king,  sustains  to  it,  as  the  source  of  all authority  and  power,  but,  (a)  From  the  fact  that  it  is  expressly asserted,  that  Christ  gave  some  apostles,  some  prophets,  some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the edifying of the saints, and for the work of the ministry. He, and not the people, constituted or appointed  the  apostles,  prophets,  pastors,  and  teachers.  (b) Ministers  are,  therefore,  called  the  servants,  the  messengers,  the ambassadors  of  Christ.  They  speak  in  Christ's  name,  and  by  his authority. They are sent by Christ to the Church, to reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. They are indeed the servants of the Church, as labouring in her service, and as subject to her authority-servants as opposed to lords-but not in the sense of deriving  their  commission  and  powers  from  the  Church.  (c)  Paul exhorts the presbyters of Ephesus, "To take heed to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers." To Archippus he says,  "Take  heed  to  the  ministry  which  thou  hast  received  in  the Lord." It was then the Holy Ghost that appointed these presbyters, and made them overseers. (d) This is involved in the whole doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ, in which he dwells by his Spirit, giving to each  member  his  gifts,  qualifications, and  functions, dividing to every one severally as he wills; and by these gifts making one an apostle, another a prophet, and another a teacher, another a worker of miracles. It is thus that the apostle reconciles the doctrine that ministers derive their authority and power from Christ, and not from the people, with the doctrine that Church powers vest ultimately in the Church as a whole. He refers to the analogy between the human body and the Church as the body of Christ. As in the human body, the soul resides not in any one part to the  exclusion  of  the  rest;  and  as  life  and  power  belong  to  it  as  a whole,  though  one  part  is  an  eye,  another  an  ear,  and  another  a</p>
<p>hand;  so  Christ,  by  his  Spirit,  dwells  in  the  Church,  and  all  power belongs  to  the  Church,  though  the  indwelling  Spirit  gives  to  each member  his  function  and  office.  So  that  ministers  are  no  more appointed by the Church, than the eye by the hands and feet. This is the representation which pervades the New Testament, and necessarily  supposes  that  the  ministers  of  the  Church  are  the servants of Christ, selected and appointed by him through the Holy Ghost.</p>
<ol>
<li>The  third  remark  relates  to  the  functions  of  the  presbyters.  (a) They are charged with the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments. They are the organs of the Church in  executing the great commission to make disciples of all nations, teaching them, and baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. (b) They are rulers in the house of God. (c) They are invested with the power of the keys, opening and shutting the door of the Church. They are clothed with all these powers in virtue of their office. If sent where the Church does not already exist, they exercise them in gathering and founding churches. If they labour in the midst of churches  already  established,  they  exercise  these  powers  in concert  with  other  presbyters,  and  with  the  representatives  of  the people. It is important to notice this distinction. The functions above mentioned belong to the ministerial office, and, therefore, to every minister. When alone he of necessity exercises his functions alone, in gathering and organizing churches; but when they are gathered, he is associated with other ministers, and with the representatives of the people, and, therefore can no  longer act alone in matters  of government and discipline.  We  see  this  illustrated  in  the  apostolic age.  The  apostles,  and  those  ordained  by  them,  acted  in  virtue  of their  ministerial  office,  singly  in  founding  churches,  but  afterwards always  in  connection  with  other  ministers  and  elders.  This  is,  in point of fact, the theory of the ministerial office included in the whole system of Presbyterianism.</li>
</ol>
<p>That  this  is  the  scriptural  view  of  the  presbyterial  office,  or  that presbyters are invested with the powers above referred to, is plain (a)</p>
<p>From the significant titles given to them in the word of God; they are called teachers, rulers, shepherds or pastors, stewards, overseers or bishops, builders, watchmen, ambassadors, witnesses. (b) From the qualifications required for the office. They must be apt to teach, well instructed, able rightly to divide the word of God, sound in the faith, able to resist gainsayers, able to rule their own families; for if a man cannot rule  his  own  house,  how  can  he  take  care  of  the  Church  of God: He must have the personal qualities which give him authority. He  must  not  be  a  novice,  but  grave,  sober,  temperate,  vigilant,  of good behaviour, and of good report.</p>
<ul>
<li>(c) From the representations given of their duties. They are to preach the word, to feed the flock of God, to guide it as a shepherd; they are to labour for the edification of the saints; to watch for souls as those who  must  give  an  account;  they  must  take  heed  to  the  Church  to guard it against false teachers, or, as the apostle calls them, "grievous wolves;" they are to exercise episcopal supervision, because the Holy Ghost,  as  Paul  said  to  the  presbyters  of  Ephesus,  had  made  them bishops, Acts xx. 28, and the Apostle Peter exhorts presbyters to feed the flock of God, taking episcopal oversight thereof, (evpiskopou/ntej) not of constraint, but willingly. They are, therefore,  bishops.  Every  time  that  word,  or  any  of  its  cognates,  is used in the New Testament, in relation to the Christian ministry, it refers to presbyters, except in Acts i. 20, where the word bishopric is used  in  a  quotation  from  the  Septuagint,  applied  to  the  office  of Judas.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  office  of  presbyters  is  a  permanent  one.  This  is  plain:  (a) Because the gift is permanent. Every office implies a gift of which it is the appointed organ. If, therefore, a gift be permanent, the organ for its exercise must be permanent. The prophets of the New Testament were the recipients of occasional inspiration. As the gift of inspiration has ceased, the office of prophet has ceased. But  as  the gift  of  teaching  and  ruling  is  permanent,  so  also  is  the  office  of teacher  and  ruler.  (b)  As  the  Church  is  commissioned  to  make disciples  of  all  nations,  to  preach  the  gospel  to  every  creature;  as</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>saints always need to be fed, and built up in their most holy faith, she must  always  have  the  officers  which  are  her  divinely  appointed organs for the accomplishment of this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>(c) We  accordingly find that the apostles not only ordained presbyters  in  every  city,  but  that  they  gave  directions  for  their ordination  in  all  subsequent  time,  prescribing  their  qualifications, and the mode of their appointment.</li>
<li>(d) In  point  of  fact,  they  have  continued  to  the  present  time.  This, therefore,  is  not  a  matter  open  to  dispute;  and  it  is  not,  in  fact, disputed by any with whom we are now concerned.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Finally,  in  relation  to  this  part  of  our  subject,  presbyters  are  the highest permanent officers of the Church.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>(a) This may be inferred, in the first place, from the fact that there are no higher permanent functions attributed in the New Testament to the Christian ministry, than those which are therein attributed to presbyters. If they are charged with the preaching of the gospel, with the  extension,  continuance,  and  purity  of  the  Church-if  they  are teachers  and  rulers,  charged  with  episcopal  powers  and  oversight, what more, of a permanent character, is demanded?</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>But secondly, it is admitted that there were, during the apostolic age,  officers  of  a  higher  grade  than  presbyters,  viz:  apostles  and prophets.  The  latter,  it  is  conceded,  were  temporary.  The  only question, therefore, relates to the apostles. Prelatists admit that there is no  permanent  class  or  grade  of  church  officers  intermediate between apostles and presbyters. But they teach that the apostleship was  designed  to  be  perpetual,  and  that  prelates  are  the  official successors of the original apostles. If this is so, if they have the office, they must have the gifts of an apostle. If they have the prerogatives, they  must  have  the  attributes  of  the  original  messengers  of  Christ. Even in civil government every office presumes inward qualifications.  An  order  of  nobility,  without  real  superiority,  is  a</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>mere sham. Much more is this necessary, in the living organism of the  Church,  in  which  the  indwelling  Spirit  manifests  himself  as  he wills. An apostle without the "word of wisdom," was a false apostle; a teacher without "the word of knowledge," was no teacher; a worker of  miracles  without  the  gift  of  miracles,  was  a  magician;  any  one pretending to speak with tongues without the gift of tongues, was a deceiver. In like manner an apostle without the gifts of an apostle, is a mere pretender. There might as well be a man without a soul.</p>
<p>Romanists tell us that the Pope is the vicar of Christ; that he is his successor as the universal head and ruler of the Church on earth. If this is so, he must be a Christ. If he has Christ's prerogatives, he must have Christ's attributes. He cannot have the one without the other. If the Pope, by divine appointment, is invested with universal dominion over the Christian world; if all his decisions as to faith and duty are infallible and authoritative; if dissent from his decision or disobedience to his commands forfeits salvation, then is her heir to the  gifts  as  well  as  to  the  office  of  Christ.  If  he  claims  the  office, without having the gifts, then is he anti-christ, "the man of sin, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." Romanists concede this  principle.  In  ascribing  to  the  Pope  the  prerogatives  of  Christ, they are forced to ascribe to him his attributes. Do they not enthrone him? Do they not kiss his feet? Do they not offer him incense? Do they not address him with blasphemous titles? Do they not pronounce  anathemas  against,  and  debar  from  heaven,  all  who  do not acknowledge his authority?</p>
<p>This  is  the  reason  why  opposition  to  Popery  in  the  breasts  of Protestants  is  a  religious  feeling.  C√¶sar  Augustus  might  rule  the world; the Czar of Russia may attain to universal dominion, but such dominion would not involve the assumption of divine attributes; and therefore submission to it would not involve apostasy from God, and opposition to it would not of necessity be a religious duty. But to be the  Vicar  of  Christ,  to  claim  to  exercise  his  prerogatives  on  earth, does involve a claim to his attributes, and therefore our opposition to Popery is opposition to a man claiming to be God.</p>
<p>But if this principle applies to the case of the Pope, as all Protestants admit, it must also apply to the apostleship. If any set of men claim to be apostles-if they assert the right to exercise apostolic authority, they cannot avoid claiming the possession of apostolic endowments; and  if  they  have  not  the  latter,  their  claim  to  the  former  is  an usurpation and pretence.</p>
<p>What, then, were the apostles? It is plain from the divine record that they were men immediately commissioned by Christ to make a full and authoritative revelation of his religion; to organize the Church; to  furnish  it  with  officers  and  laws,  and  to  start  it  on  its  career  of conquest through the world.</p>
<p>To  qualify  them  for  this  work,  they  received,  first,  the  word  of wisdom,  or  a  complete  revelation  of  the  doctrines  of  the  gospel; secondly,  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  in  such  manner  as  to  render them infallible in the communication of the truth, and in the exercise of  their  authority  as  rulers;  thirdly,  the  gift  of  working  miracles  in confirmation of their mission, and of communicating the Holy Ghost by the imposition of their hands.</p>
<p>The  prerogatives  arising  out  of  these  gifts,  were,  first-absolute authority  in  all  matters  of  faith  and  practice;  secondly,  authority equally  absolute  in  legislating  for  the  Church  as  to  its  constitution and laws; thirdly, universal jurisdiction over the officers and members of the Church.</p>
<p>Paul,  when  he  claimed  to  be  an  apostle,  claimed  this  immediate commission,  this  revelation  of  the  gospel,  this  plenary  inspiration, and this absolute authority and general jurisdiction. And in support of his claims, he appeals not only to the manifest co-operation of God through the Spirit, but to the signs of an apostle, which he wrought in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 2 Cor. xii. 12.</p>
<p>It followed necessarily from the actual possession by the apostles of these  gifts of revelation  and  inspiration,  which  rendered  them infallible, that agreement with them in faith, and subjection to them were necessary to salvation.  The  apostle  John,  therefore,  said,  "He that knoweth God heareth us; and he that is not of God, heareth not us. Hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." 1 John iv.  6.  And  the  apostle  Paul  pronounced  accursed  even  an  angel should he deny the gospel which he preached, and as he preached it. The writings of the apostles, therefore, have in all ages and in every part of the Church, been regarded as infallible and authoritative in all matters of faith and practice.</p>
<p>Now, the argument is, that if prelates are apostles, they must have apostolic  gifts.  They  have  not  those  gifts,  therefore  they  are  not apostles. The first members of this syllogism can hardly need further proof.  It  is  evident  from  the  nature  of  the  case,  and  from  the Scriptures,  that  the  prerogatives  of  the  apostles  arose  out  of  their peculiar endowments.  It  was  because  they  were  inspired,  and consequently  infallible,  that  they  were  invested  with  the  authority which they exercised. An uninspired apostle is as much a solecism as an uninspired prophet.</p>
<p>As to the second point, viz.: that prelates have not apostolic gifts, it needs  no  argument.  They  have  no  special  revelation;  they  are  not inspired, they have not either the power of working miracles, or of conferring miraculous gifts, and, therefore, they are not apostles.</p>
<p>So inseparable is the connection between an office and its gifts, that prelates,  in  claiming  to  be  apostles,  are  forced  to  make  a  show  of possessing  apostolic  gifts.  Though  not  inspired  individually,  they claim to be inspired as a body; though not infallible singly, they claim to  be  infallible  collectively;  though  they  have  not  the  power  of conferring miraculous gifts, they claim the power of giving the grace of orders. These claims, however, are not less preposterous than the assumptions  of  personal  inspiration.  The  historical  fact,  that  the prelates  collectively,  as  well  as  individually,  are  uninspired  and fallible, is not less palpable than that they are mortal. Those of one age differed from those of another. Those of one Church pronounced accursed  those  of  another-Greeks  against  Latins,  Latins  against Greeks, and Anglicans against both. Besides, if prelates are apostles, then  there  can  be  no  religion  and  no  salvation  among  those  not subject  to  their  authority.  He  is  not  of  God,  said  the  apostle  John, who  heareth  not  us.  This  is  a  conclusion  which  Romanists  and Anglicans  admit,  and  boldly  assert.  It  is,  however,  a  complete reductio ad absurdum. It might as well be asserted that the sun never shines out of Greenland, as that there is no religion beyond the pale of  prelatical  churches.  To  maintain  this  position,  necessitates  the perversion of the very nature of religion. As faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,  repentance  towards  God,  love,  and  holy  living,  are  found outside of prelatical churches, prelatists maintain that religion does not consist in these fruits of the Spirit, but in something external and formal.  The  assumption,  therefore,  that  prelates  are  apostles,  of necessity  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  prelates  have  the  gifts  of  the apostles, and that to the conclusion that submission to their teaching and  jurisdiction,  is  essential  to  salvation;  and  that  again,  to  the conclusion  that  religion  is  not  an  inward  state,  but  an  external relation. These are not merely the logical, but the historical sequences  of  the  theory  that  the apostolic office is perpetual. Wherever  that  theory  has  prevailed,  it  has  led  to  making  religion ceremonial, and divorcing it from piety and morality. We would beg those who love Christ more than their order, and those who believe in evangelical religion, to lay this consideration  to  heart. The doctrine  of  a  perpetual  apostleship  in  the  Church,  is  not  a  mere speculative error, but one, to the last degree, destructive.</p>
<p>We cannot  pursue  this  subject  further.  That  the  apostolic  office  is temporary, is a plain historical fact. The apostles, the twelve, stand out  just  as  conspicuous  as  an  isolated  body  in  the  history  of  the Church,  without  predecessors,  and  without  successors,  as  Christ himself does. They disappear from history. The title, the thing itself, the gifts, the functions, all ceased when John, the last of the twelve, ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>If  it  is  a  fearful  thing  to  put  the  Pope  in  the  place  of  Christ,  and to make a man our God; it is also a fearful thing to put erring men in the place of infallible apostles, and make faith in their teaching, and submission to their authority, the condition of grace and salvation.</p>
<p>From  this  awful  bondage,  brethren,  we  are  free.  We  bow  to  the authority  of  Christ.  We  submit  to  the  infallible  teachings  of  his inspired apostles; but we deny that the infallible is continued in the fallible, or the divine in the human.</p>
<p>But  if  the  apostolic  office  was  temporary,  then  presbyters  are  the highest permanent officers of the Church, because, as is conceded by nine-tenths,  perhaps  by  ninety-nine  hundredths  of  prelates,  the Scriptures make no mention of any permanent officers intermediate between the apostles and the presbyter-bishops of the New Testament. There is no command to appoint such officers, no record of their appointment, no specification of their qualifications, no title for  them,  either  in  the  Scriptures  or  in  ecclesiastical  history.  If prelates  are  not  apostles,  they  are  presbyters,  holding  their  preeminence by human, and not by divine authority.</p>
<p>III. As then presbyters are all of the same rank, and as they exercise their power in the government of the Church, in connection with the people,  or their representatives,  this of necessity  gives rise to Sessions in our individual congregations, and to Presbyteries, Synods, and Assemblies, for the exercise of more extended jurisdiction.  This brings  into view  the  third great principle of Presbyterianism,  the  government  of  the  Church  by  judicatories composed  of  presbyters  and  elders,  &amp;c.  This  takes  for  granted  the unity of the Church in opposition to the theory of the Independents.</p>
<p>The Presbyterian doctrine on this subject is, that the Church is one in such a sense that a smaller part is subject to a larger, and the larger to the whole. It has one Lord, one faith, one baptism. The principles of  government laid down in the Scriptures bind the whole Church. The terms of demission, and the legitimate grounds of exclusion, are everywhere the same. The same qualifications are everywhere to be demanded for admission to the sacred office, and the same grounds for deposition. Every man who is properly received as a member of a particular church, becomes a member of the Church universal; every one  rightfully  excluded  from  a  particular  church,  is  excluded  from the  whole  Church;  every  one  rightfully  ordained  to  the  ministry  in one  church,  is a minister  of the universal  Church,  and  when rightfully deposed in one, he ceases to be a minister in any. Hence, while every particular church has a right to manage its own affairs and  administer  its  own  discipline,  it  cannot  be  independent  and irresponsible  in  the  exercise  of  that  right.  As  its  members  are members of the Church universal, and those whom it excommunicates  are,  according  to  the  Scriptural  theory,  delivered unto Satan, and cut off from the communion of the saints, the acts of a  particular  church  become  the  acts  of  the  whole  Church,  and therefore  the  whole  has  the  right  to  see  that  they  are  performed according to the law of Christ. Hence, on the one hand, the right of appeal; and, on the other, the right of review and control.</p>
<p>This is the Presbyterian theory on this subject; that it is the scriptural doctrine appears, 1. From the nature of the Church. The Church is everywhere represented as one. It is one body, one family, one fold, one kingdom. It is one because pervaded by one Spirit. We are all baptized into one Spirit so as to become, says the apostle, on body. This  indwelling  of  the  Spirit  which  thus  unites  all  the  members  of Christ's  body,  produces  not  only  that  subjective  or  inward  union which manifests itself in sympathy and affection, in unity of faith and love, but also outward union and communion. It leads Christians to unite for the purposes of worship, and of mutual watch and care. It requires them to be subject to one another in the fear of the Lord. It brings them all into subjection to the word of God as the standard of faith and practice. It gives them not only an interest in each other's welfare,  purity,  and  edification,  but  it  imposes  the  obligation  to promote these objects. If one member suffers, all suffer with it; and if one  member  is  honoured,  all  rejoice  with  it.  All  this  is  true,  not merely  of  those  frequenting  the  same  place  of  worship,  but  of  the universal  body  of  believers.  So  that  an  independent  church  is  as much a solecism as an independent Christian, or as an independent finger of the human body, or an independent branch of a tree. If the Church  is  a  living  body  united  to  the  same  head,  governed  by  the same laws, and pervaded by the same Spirit, it is impossible that one part should be independent of all the rest.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All  the  reasons  which  require  the  subjection  of  a  believer  to  the brethren  of  a  particular  church,  require  his  subjection  to  all  his brethren in the Lord. The ground of this obligation is not the church covenant.  It  is  not  the  compact  into  which  a  number  of  believers enter,  and  which  binds  only  those  who  are  parties  to  it.  Church power has a much higher source than the consent of the governed. The Church is a divinely constituted society, deriving its power from its  charter.  Those  who  join  it,  join  it  as  an  existing  society,  and  a society existing with certain prerogatives and privileges, which they come to share, and not to bestow. This divinely constituted society, which  every  believer  is  bound  to  join,  is  not  the  local  and  limited association of his own neighbourhood, but the universal brotherhood of  believers;  and  therefore  all  his  obligations  of  communion  and obedience terminate on the whole Church. He is bound to obey his brethren, not because he has agreed to do so, but because they are his brethren-because they are temples of the Holy Ghost, enlightened, sanctified, and guided by Him.  It is impossible, therefore,  to  limit  the  obedience  of  a  Christian  to  the  particular congregation  of  which  he  is  a  member,  or  to  make  one  such congregation  independent  of  all  others,  without  utterly  destroying the  very  nature  of  the  Church,  and  tearing  asunder  the  living members of Christ's body. If this attempt should be fully accomplished,  these  separate  churches  would  as  certainly  bleed  to death, as a limb when severed from the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Church, during the apostolic age, did not consist of isolated, independent congregations, but was one body, of which the separate churches were constituent members, each subject to all the rest, or to an authority which extended over all. This appears, in the first place, from the history of the origin of those churches. The apostles were commanded to remain in Jerusalem until they received power from on high. On the day of Pentecost the promised Spirit was poured out, and  they  began  to  speak  as  the  Spirit  gave  them  utterance.  Many thousands in that city were added to the Lord, and they continued in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayer.  They  constituted  the  Church  in  Jerusalem.  It  was  one  not only  spiritually,  but  externally,  united  in  the  same  worship,  and subject to the same rulers. When scattered abroad, they preached the word everywhere, and great multitudes were added to the Church. The  believers  in  every  place  were  associated  in  separate,  but  not independent  churches,  for  they  all  remained  subject  to  a  common tribunal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For, secondly, the apostles constituted a bond of union to the whole body of believers. There is not the slightest evidence that the apostles had different dioceses. Paul wrote with full authority to the Church in Rome before he had ever visited the imperial city. Peter  addressed his epistles to the churches  of  Pontus,  Cappadocia,  Asia,  and Bithynia, the very centre of Paul's field of labour. That the apostles exercised  this  general  jurisdiction,  and  were  thus  the  bond  of external union to the Church, arose, as we have seen, from the very nature  of  their  office.  Having  been  commissioned  to  found  and organize the Church, and being so filled with the Spirit as to render them  infallible,  their  word  was  law.  Their  inspiration  necessarily secured  this  universal  authority.  We  accordingly  find  that  they everywhere  exercised  the  powers  not  only  of  teachers,  but  also  of rulers. Paul speaks of the power given to him for edification; of the things which he ordained in all the churches. His epistles are filled with  such  orders,  which  were  binding  authority  then  as  now.  He threatens the Corinthians to come to them with a rod; he cut off a member of their church, whom they had neglected to discipline; and he delivered Hymeneus and Alexander unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme. As a historical fact, therefore, the apostolic churches were not independent congregations, but were all subject to one common authority.</p>
<p>In  the  third  place,  this  is  further  evident  from  the  Council  at Jerusalem. Nothing need be assumed that is not expressly mentioned  in  the  record.  The  simple  facts  of  the  case  are,  that  a controversy having arisen in the church at Antioch, concerning the Mosaic law, instead of settling it among themselves as an independent body, they referred the case to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem,  and  there  it  was  authoritatively  decided,  not  for  that church only, but for all others. Paul, therefore, in his next missionary journey,  as  he  "passed  through  the  cities,  delivered  to  them,"  it  is said,  "the  decrees  for  to  keep,  which  were  ordained  of  the  apostles and  elders  which  were  at  Jerusalem."  Acts  xvi.  4.  It  matters  not whether the authority of that Council was due to the inspiration of its chief  members  or  not.  It  is  enough  that  it  had  authority  over  the whole Church. The several congregations were not independent, but were united under one common tribunal.</p>
<p>4th. In the fourth place, we may appeal to the common consciousness of Christians, as manifested in the whole history of the Church. Everything organic has what may  be called a nisus formativus; an inward force, by which it is impelled to assume the form suited to its nature. This inward impulse may, by circumstances, be impeded or misdirected, so that the normal state of a plant or animal may never be attained. Still, this force never fails to manifest its existence, nor the state to which it tends. What is thus true in nature, is no less true in the Church. There is nothing more conspicuous  in  her  history  than  the  law  by  which  believers  are impelled to express their inward unity by outward union. It has been manifested in all ages, and under all circumstances. It gave rise to all the early councils. It determined the idea of heresy and schism. It led to the exclusion from all churches of those who, for the denial of the common  faith,  were  excluded  from  any  one,  and  who  refused  to acknowledge their subjection to the Church as a whole. This feeling was clearly exhibited at the time of the Reformation. The churches then formed, ran together as naturally as drops of quicksilver; and when this union was prevented by internal or external circumstances, it was deplored as a great evil. It may do for men of the world to attribute this remarkable characteristic in the history of the Church, to the love of power, or to some other unworthy source. But it is not thus to be accounted for. It is a law of the Spirit. If what all  men  do,  is  to  be  referred  to  some  abiding  principle  of  human nature; what all Christians do, must be referred to something which belongs to them as Christians.</p>
<p>So deeply seated is this  conviction  that  outward  union  and  mutual subjection is the normal state of the Church, that it manifests itself in those whose theory leads them to deny and resist it. Their Consociations,  Associations,  and  Advisory  Councils,  are  so  many devices to satisfy an inward craving, and to prevent the dissolution to which it is felt that absolute Independency must inevitably lead. That then, the Church is one, in the sense that a smaller part should be subject to a larger, and a larger to the whole, is evident. 1. From its nature as being one kingdom, one family, one body, having one head, one faith,  one  written  constitution,  and  actuated  by  one  Spirit;  2d. From the command of Christ that we should obey our brethren, not because they live near to us; not because we have covenanted to obey them; but because they are our brethren, the temples and organs of the  Holy  Ghost;  3.  From  the  fact  that  during  the  apostolic  age  the churches were not independent bodies, but subject in all matters of doctrine, order, and discipline, to a common tribunal; and 4. Because the whole history of the Church proves that this union and mutual subjection is the normal state of the Church towards which it strives by  an  inward  law  of  its  being.  If  it  is  necessary  that  one  Christian should be subject to other Christians; it is no less necessary that one church should be subject in the same spirit, to the same extent, and on the same grounds, to other churches.</p>
<p>We have now completed our exposition of Presbyterianism. It must strike  every  one  that  it  is  no  device  of  man.  It  is  not  an  external framework, having no connection with the inward life of the Church. It is a real growth. It is the outward expression of the inward law of the  Church's  being.  If  we  teach  that  the  people  should  have  a substantive  part  in  the  government  of  the  Church,  it  is  not  merely because  we  deem  it  healthful  and  expedient,  but  because  the  Holy Ghost dwells in the people of God, and gives the ability and confers the  right  to  govern.  If  we  teach  that  presbyters  are  the  highest permanent officers of the Church, it is because those gifts by which the apostles and prophets were raised above presbyters, have, in fact, ceased. If we teach that the separate congregations of believers are not independent, it is because the Church is, in fact, one body, all the parts of which are mutually dependent.</p>
<p>If this  is  so-if  there  is  an  outward  form  of  the  Church  which corresponds  with  its  inward  life,  a  form  which  is  the  natural expression  and  product  of  that  life,  then  that  form  must  be  most conducive to its progress and development. Men may, by art, force a tree to grow in any fantastic shape a perverted taste may choose. But it  is  at  the  sacrifice  of  its  vigour  and  productiveness.  To  reach  its perfection, it must be left to unfold itself according to the law of its nature. It is so with the Church. If the people possess the gifts and graces which qualify and entitle them to take part in the government, then the exercise of that right tends to the development of those gifts and graces; and the denial of the right tends to their depression. In all the forms of despotism, whether civil or ecclesiastical, the people are degraded;  and  in  all forms  of scriptural liberty, they are proportionably  elevated.  Every  system  which  demands  intelligence tends  to  produce  it.  Every  man  feels  that  it  is  not  only  one  of  the greatest advantages of our republican institutions that they tend to the education and elevation of the people, but that their successful operation,  demanding  popular  intelligence  and  virtue,  renders  it necessary that constant exertion should be directed to the attainment of  that  end.  As  republican  institutions  cannot  exist  among  the ignorant  and  vicious,  so  Presbyterianism  must  find  the  people enlightened and virtuous, or make them so.</p>
<p>It  is  the  combination  of  the  principles  of  liberty  and  order  in  the Presbyterian  system,  the  union  of  the  rights  of  the  people  with subjection  to  legitimate  authority,  that  has  made  it  the  parent  and guardian of civil liberty in every part of the world. This, however, is merely an incidental advantage. The Church organization has higher aims.  It  is  designed  for  the  extension  and  establishment  of  the gospel, and for the edification of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God; and that polity must be best adapted to this end, which is most congenial with the  inward  nature  of  the  Church.  It  is  on  this  ground  we  rest  our preference  for  Presbyterianism.  We  do  not  regard  it  as  a  skilful product of  human wisdom; but as a divine institution, founded on the word of God, and as the genuine product of the inward life of the Church.</p>
<p>[1] This point is argued at length by Turrettin, in his chapter, De Jure Vocationis.  He  proves  that  the  right  to  call  and  appoint  ministers belongs  to  the  whole  Church:  1.  Quia  data  est  eccclesiis  potestas clavium.  He  quotes  Tostatus,  who,  he  says,  proves  by  various arguments, "Claves  datas  esse  toti  ecclesi√¶,  atque  adeo  jus  illarum exercedarum ad eam primario et radicaliter pertinere, ad alios vero tantum secundario et participative. 2. Idem  probatur ex jure ministerii,  quod  ecclesi√¶  competit.  3.  Ex  jure  superioritatis.  Quia auctoritas et jus actionis ad superiorem, non ad inferiorem pertinet. At  ecclesia  est  superior  pastoribus,  non  pastores  ecclesi√¶.  4.  Ex probatione doctorum. Quia ad illum pertinet jus vocandi, cujus est discernere doctores a seductoribus, probare sanam  doctrinam, vocem  Christi  a  voce  pseudapostolorum  distinguere,  alienum  non sequi,  anathematizare  eos  qui  aliud  evangelium  pr√¶dicant.  5.  Ex praxi  apostolorum.  6.  Ex  ecclesia  primativa.  Gerhard,  the  great Lutheran  theologian  of  the  seventeenth  century,  teaches  the  same doctrine. Tomus xii. P. 85. Cuicunque claves regni c≈ìlorum ab ipso Christo sunt tradit√¶, penes eum est jus vocandi ecclesi√¶ ministros.</p>
<p>Atqui toti ecclesi√¶ tradit√¶ sunt a Christo claves regni c≈ìlorum. Ergo penes totam ecclesiam est just vocandi ministros. Propositio confirmata  ex  definitione  clavium  regni  c≈ìlorum.  Per  claves  enim potestas  ecclesiastica intelligitur, cujus pars  est jus vocandi  et constituendi  ecclesi√¶  ministros.  He  quotes  Augustin,  lib.  I.  De doctrina  Christ,  cap.  18:  "Has  claves  dedit  ecclesi√¶  suae,  ut  qu√¶ solveret in terra, soluta essent in coelo, et qu√¶ ligaret in terra, ligata essent in coelo."</p>
<p>In the Smalcald Articles it is said-"Ad h√¶c necesse est fateri, quod claves  non  ad  personam  unius  certi  hominis,  sed  ad  ecclesiam pertineant,  ut  multa  clarissima  et  firmissima  argumenta  testantur. Nam Christus de clavibus dicens, Matt. Xviii. addit: ubi cunque duo vel  tres  consenserint  super  terram  etc  Tribuit  igitur  principaliter claves  ecclesi√¶,  et  immediate;  sicut  et  ob  eam  causam  ecclesia principaliter habet jus vocationis.-Hase, Libri Symbolici, p. 345.</p>
<p>Ubicunque  est  ecclesia,  ibi  est  jus  administrandi  evangelii.  Quare necesse est, ecclesiam retinere jus vocandi et ordinandi ministros. Et hoc  jus  est  donum  proprie  datum  ecclesi√¶,  quod  nulla  humana auctoritas ecclesi√¶ eripere potest.-Ibid p. 353.</p>

<p>What is Meant by Adopting the Westminster Confession?</p>
<p>by Charles Hodge, D.D.</p>
<p>Every minister at his ordination is required to declare that he adopts the Westminster  Confession  and  Catechism,  as  containing  the system of doctrine taught in the Sacred Scriptures. There are three ways in which these words have been, and still are, interpreted. First, some understand them to mean that every proposition contained in the  Confession  of  Faith  is  included  in  the  profession  made  at ordination. Secondly, others say that they mean just what the words import. What is adopted is the "system of doctrine." The system of the Reformed Churches is a known and admitted scheme of doctrine; and that scheme, nothing more or less, we profess to adopt. The third view of the subject is, that by the system of doctrine contained in the Confession  is  meant  the  essential  doctrines  of  Christianity  and nothing more.</p>
<p>As to the first of these interpretations, it is enough to say- l. That it is not  the  meaning  of  the  words.  There  are  many  propositions contained in the Westminster Confession which do not belong to the integrity  of  the  Augustinian  or  Reformed  system.  A  man  may  be  a true  Augustinian  or  Calvinist,  and  not  believe  that  the  Pope  is  the Antichrist predicted by St. Paul; or that the 18th chapter of Leviticus is still binding.  2.  Such  a  rule  of  interpretation  can  never  be practically carried out, without dividing the Church into innumerable fragments. It is impossible that a body of several thousand ministers and elders should think alike on all the topics embraced in such an extended and minute formula of belief. 3. Such has never been the rule adopted in our Church. Individuals have held it, but the Church as a body never has. No prosecution for doctrinal error has ever been attempted or sanctioned, except for errors which were regarded as involving  the  rejection,  not  of  explanations  of  doctrines,  but  of  the doctrines  themselves.  For  example,  our  Confession  teaches  the doctrine of original sin. That doctrine is essential to the Reformed or Calvinistic  system.  Any  man  who  denies  that  doctrine,  thereby rejects the system taught in our Confession, and cannot with a good conscience say that he adopts it. Original sin, however, is one thing; the way in which it is accounted for, is another. The doctrine is, that such  is the relation between  Adam  and  his  posterity,  that  all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, are born in a state of sin and condemnation. Any man who admits this, holds the doctrine. But there are at least three ways of accounting for this fact. The  scriptural  explanation  as  given  in  our  Standards  is,  that  "the covenant  being  made  with  Adam,  not  only  for  himself,  but  for  his posterity, all mankind, descending from him by ordinary generation, sinned in him, and fell with him, in his first transgression." The fact that mankind fell into that estate of sin and misery in which they are born, is accounted for on the principle of representation. Adam was constituted our head and representative, so that his sin is the judicial ground of our condemnation and of the consequent loss of the divine image, and of the state of spiritual death in which all men come into the world. This, as it is the scriptural, so it is the Church view of the subject. It is the view held in the Latin and the Lutheran, as well as in the Reformed Church, and therefore belongs to the Church catholic. Still  it  is  not  essential  to  the  doctrine.  Realists  admit  the  doctrine, but,  unsatisfied  with  the  principle  of  representative  responsibility, assume that humanity as a generic life acted and sinned in Adam; and, therefore, that his sin is the act, with its demerit and consequences, of every man in whom that generic life is individualized.  Others,  accepting  neither  of  these  solutions,  assert that the fact of original sin (i.e., the sinfulness and condemnation of man  at birth) is to be accounted for in the general law of propagation. Like begets like. Adam became sinful, and hence all his posterity are born in t state of sin, or with a sinful nature. Although these views are not equally scriptural, or equally in harmony with our Confession,  nevertheless  they  leave  the  doctrine  intact,  and  do  not work a rejection of the system of which it is an essential part.</p>
<p>So also of the doctrine of inability. That man is by the fall rendered utterly  indisposed, opposite, and disabled to all spiritual good, is a doctrine of the Confession as well as of Scripture. And it is essential to  the  system  of  doctrine  embraced  by  all  the  Reformed  Church. Whether men have plenary power to regenerate themselves, or can co-operate in the work of their regeneration, or can effectually resist the  converting  grace  of  God,  are  questions  which  have  separated</p>
<p>Pelagians, the later Romanists,  Semi-Pelagians,  Lutherans,  and Arminians,  from  Augustinians  or  Calvinists.  The  denial  of  the inability of fallen man, therefore, of necessity works the rejection of Calvinism. But if the fact be admitted, it is not essential whether the inability be called natural or moral; whether it be attributed solely to the perverseness of the will, or to the blindness of the understanding. These points of difference are not unimportant, but they do not affect the essence of the doctrine.</p>
<p>Our  Confession  teaches  that  God  foreordains  whatever  comes  to pass;  that  he  executes  his  decrees  in  the  works  of  creation  and providence;  that  his  providential  government  is  holy,  wise,  and powerful, controlling all his creatures and all their actions; that from the  fallen  mass  of  men  he  has,  from  all  eternity,  of  his  mere  good pleasure, elected some to everlasting life; that by the incarnation and mediatorial work of his eternal Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the effectual working of his Spirit, he has rendered the salvation of his  people  absolutely  certain;  that  the  reason  why  some  are  saved and others not, is not the foresight of their faith and repentance, but solely  because  he  has  elected  some  and  not  others,  and  that  in execution of his purpose, in his own good time, he sends them the Holy Spirit. who so operates on them as to render their repentance, faith, and holy living absolutely certain. Now it is plain that men may differ  as  to  the  mode  of  God's  providential  government,  or  the operations  of  his  grace,  and  retain  the  facts  which  constitute  the essence  of  this  doctrinal  scheme.  But  if  any  one  teaches  that  God cannot effectually control the acts of free agents without destroying their  liberty;  that  he  cannot  render  the  repentance  or  faith  of  any man certain; that he does all he can to convert every man, it would be an insult to reason and conscience, to say that he held the system of doctrine which embraces the facts and principles above stated.</p>
<p>The same strain of remark might be made in reference to the other great  doctrines  which  constitute  the  Augustinian  system.  Enough, however, has been said to illustrate the principle of interpretation for which  Old  School  men  contend.  We  do  not  expect  our  ministers should  adopt  every  proposition  contained  in  our  Standards.  This they  are  not  required  to  do.  But  they  are  required  to  adopt  the system;  and  that  system  consists  of  certain  doctrines;  no  one  of which can be omitted without destroying its identity. Those doctrines are:-the  plenary  inspiration  of  the  Scriptures  of  the  Old  and  New Testaments, and the consequent infallibility of all their teachings;doctrine  of  the  Trinity;  that  there  is  one  God  subsisting  in  three persons, the Father, Son, and Spirit, the same in substance and equal in power and glory;-the doctrine of decrees and predestination, as above stated;-the doctrine of creation, viz., that the universe and all that it contains is not eternal, is not a necessary product of the life of God,  is  not  an  emanation  from  the  divine  substance,  but  owes  its existence,  as  to  substance  and  form,  solely  to  his  will;  and  in reference  to  man,  that  he  was  created  in  the  image  of  God,  in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, and not in puris naturalibus, without any moral character;-the doctrine of providence, or that God effectually governs all his creatures and all their actions, so that nothing  comes  to  pass  which  is  not  in accordance with his infinitely wise, holy, and benevolent purposes;the  doctrines  of  the  covenants;  the  first,  or  covenant  of  works, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity, upon condition  of  perfect  and  personal  obedience;  and  the  second,  or covenant  of  grace,  wherein  God  freely  offers  unto  sinners  life  and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved, and promising to give, unto all who are ordained unto life,  his  Holy  Spirit,  to  make  them  willing  and  able  to  believe;-the doctrine concerning Christ our Mediator, ordained of God to be our Prophet, Priest, and King, the Head and Saviour of his Church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world; unto whom he did. from eternity, give a people to be his seed, to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified; and that the eternal Son of God of one substance with the Father, took upon him man's nature, so that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion; that this Lord Jesus Christ, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, hath fully satisfied</p>
<p>the justice of his Father, and purchased not only reconciliation, but an  everlasting  inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven  for  all  those whom the Father hath given to him;-the doctrine of free will; viz., that  man was created not only a free agent, but with full ability to choose  good  or  evil,  and  by  that  choice  determine  his  future character  and  destiny;  that  by  the  fall  he  has  lost  this  ability  to spiritual  good;  that  in  conversion,  God,  by  his  Spirit,  enables  the sinner freely to repent and believe;-the doctrine of effectual calling, or regeneration; that those, and those only, whom  God  has predestinated unto life, he effectually calls, by his Word and Spirit, from  a  state  of  spiritual  death  to  a  state  of  spiritual  life,  renewing their wills, and by his almighty power determining their wills, thus effectually drawing them to Christ; yet so that they come most freely; and that this effectual calling is of God's free and special grace alone, not  from  anything  foreseen  in  man;-the  doctrine  of  justification; that it is a free act, or act of grace on the part of God; that it does not consist in any subjective change of state, nor simply in pardon, but includes a declaring and accepting the sinner as righteous; that it is founded not on anything wrought in us or done by us; not on faith or evangelical obedience, but simply on what Christ has done for us,i.e., in  his  obedience  and  sufferings  unto  death;  this  righteousness  of Christ being a proper, real, and full satisfaction to the justice of God, his  exact  justice  and  rich  grace  are  glorified  in  the  justification  of sinners;-the doctrine of adoption; that those who are justified are received into the family of God, and made partakers of the Spirit and privileges of his children;-the doctrine of sanctification; that those once  regenerated  by  the  Spirit  of  God  are,  by  his  power  and indwelling,  in  the  use  of  the  appointed  means  of  grace,  rendered more and more holy; which work, although always imperfect in this life, is perfected at death;-the doctrine of saving faith; that it is the gift  of  God,  and  work  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  by  which  the  Christian receives as true, on the authority of God, whatever is revealed in his Word; the special  acts  of  which  faith  are  the  receiving  and  resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life;the  doctrine  of  repentance;  that  the  sinner,  out  of  the  sight  and sense,  not  only  of  the  danger,  but  the  odiousness  of  sin,  and apprehension  of  the  mercy  of  God  in  Christ,  does,  with  grief  and hatred of his own sins, turn from them unto God, with full purpose and  endeavour  after  new  obedience;-the  doctrine  of  good  works; that  they  are  such  only  as  God  has  commanded;  that  they  are  the fruits of faith; that such works, although not necessary as the ground of  our  justification,  are  indispensable,  in  the  case  of  adults,  as  the uniform products of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of believers;-the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints; that those once effectually called and sanctified by the Spirit can never totally or finally  fall  from  a  state  of  grace;  because  the  decree  of  election  is immutable;  because  Christ's  merit  is  infinite,  and  his  intercession constant;  because  the  Spirit  abides  with  the  people  of  God;  and because  the  covenant  of  grace  secures  the  salvation  of  all  who believe;-the doctrine of assurance; that the assurance of salvation is desirable, possible, and obligatory, but is not of the essence of faith; -the doctrine of the law; that it is a revelation of the will of God, and a  perfect  rule  of  righteousness;  that  it  is  perpetually  obligatory  on justified  persons  as  well  as  on  others,  although  believers  are  not under it  as  a  covenant  of  works;-the  doctrine  of  Christian  liberty; that it includes freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemnation of the law, from a legal spirit, from the bondage of Satan and dominion of sin, from the world, and ultimately from all evil, together with free access to God as his children. Since the advent of Christ, his people are freed also from the yoke of the ceremonial law. God alone is the Lord of the conscience, which he has set free from the doctrines and commandments of men, which are in anything contrary to his Word, or beside it, in matters of faith or worship. The doctrines concerning worship  and  the  Sabbath,  concerning  vows  and  oaths,  of  the  civil magistrate, of marriage, contain nothing peculiar to our system, or which  is  matter  of  controversy  among  Presbyterians.  The  same  is true as to what the Confession teaches concerning the Church, of the communion of saints, of the sacraments, and of the future state, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of the final judgment.</p>
<p>That  such  is  the  system  of  doctrine  of  the  Reformed  Church  is  a matter of history. It is the system which, as the granite formation of the  Earth,  underlies  and  sustains  the  whole  scheme  of  truth  as revealed  in  the  Scriptures,  and  without  which  all  the  rest  is  as drifting sand. It has been from the beginning the life and soul of the Church, taught explicitly by our Lord himself, and more fully by his inspired servants, and always professed by a cloud of witnesses in the Church.  It  has,  moreover,  ever  been  the  esoteric  faith  of  true believers,  adopted  in  their  prayers  and  hymns,  even  when  rejected from their creeds. It is this system which the Presbyterian Church is pledged to profess, to defend, and to teach; and it is a breach of faith to God and man if she fails to require a profession of this system by all those whom she receives or ordains as teachers and guides of her people. It is for the adoption of the Confession of Faith in this sense that the Old School have always contended as a matter of conscience.</p>
<p>There  has,  however,  always  been  a  party  in  the  Church  which adopted  the  third  method  of  understanding  the  words  "system  of doctrine,"  in  the  ordination  service-viz.,  that  they  mean  nothing more than the essential doctrines of religion or of Christianity.</p>
<p>That  such  a  party  has  existed  is  plain-l.  Because,  in  our  original Synod, President Dickinson and several other members openly took this ground. President Dickinson was opposed to all human creeds; he  resisted  the  adoption  of  the  Westminster  Confession,  and  he succeeded in having it adopted with the ambiguous words, "as to all the  essential  principles  of  religion."  This  may  mean  the  essential principles of Christianity, or the essential principles of the peculiar system  taught  in  the  Confession  2.  This  mode  of  adopting  the Confession gave rise to immediate and general complaint. 3. When President Davis was in England, the latitudinarian Presbyterians and other Dissenters from  the Established Church  from  whom  he expected  encouragement  and  aid  in  his  mission,  objected  that  our Synod had adopted the Westminster Confession in its strict meaning. President Davis replied that the Synod required candidates to adopt it  only  as  to  "the  articles  essential  to  Christianity."  4.  The  Rev.  Mr. Creaghead, member of the original Synod, withdrew from it on the ground of this lax rule of adoption. 5. The Rev. Mr. Harkness, when suspended  from  the  ministry  by  the  Synod  for  doctrinal  errors, complained of the injustice and inconsistency of such censure, on the ground  that  the  Synod  required  the  adoption  only  of  the  essential doctrines of the Gospel, no one of which he had called in question.</p>
<p>While it is thus apparent that there was a party in the Church who adopted this latitudinarian principle of subscription, the Synod itself never did adopt it. This is plain, because what we call the Adopting Act,  and  which  includes  the  ambiguous  language  in  question,  the Synod  call  "their  Preliminary  Act;"  i.e.,  an  Act  preliminary  to  the actual  adoption  of  the  Westminster  Confession.  That  adoption  was effected in a subsequent meeting (on the afternoon of the same day), in which the Confession was adopted in all its articles, except what in the twenty-third chapter related to the power of the civil magistrate in matters  of  religion.  This  is  what  the  Synod  itself  called  its Adopting Act... When in 1787 the General Assembly was organized, it was solemnly declared that the Westminster Confession of Faith, as then revised and corrected, was part of the CONSTITUTION of this Church. No man has ever yet maintained that in adopting Republican  constitution,  it  was  accepted  only  as  embracing  the general principles of government common to monarchies, aristocracies, and democracies.</p>
<p>The  Old  School  have  always  protested  against  this  Broad  Church principle-1. Because, in their view, it is immoral. For a man to assert that he adopts a Calvinistic confession when he rejects the distinctive features  of  the  Calvinistic  system,  and  receives  only  the  essential principles of Christianity, is to say what is not true in the legitimate and accepted meaning  of the terms. It would be universally recognized  as  a  falsehood  should  a  Protestant  declare  that  he adopted the canons of the Council of Trent, or the Romish Catechism,  when  he  intended  that  he  received  them  only  so  far  as they contained the substance of the Apostles' Creed. If the Church is prepared  to  make  the  Apostles'  Creed  the  standard  of  ministerial communion, let the constitution be altered; but do not let us adopt the  demoralizing  principle  of  professing  ourselves,  and  requiring others to profess, what we do not believe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A  second  objection  to  the  lax  rule  of  interpretation  is,  that  it  is contrary to the very principle on which our Church was founded, and on which, as t Church, it has always professed to act.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The  Old  School  have  always  believed  that  it  was  the  duty  of  the Church, as a witness for the truth, to hold fast that great system of truth  which  in  all  ages  has  been  the  faith  of  the  great  body  of  the people of God, and on which, as they believe, the best interests of the Church and of the world depend.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>This  lax  principle  must  work  the  relaxation  of  all  discipline, destroy  the  purity  of  the  Church,  and  introduce  either  perpetual conflict or death-like indifference.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>There always has been, and still is, a body of men who feel it their duty  to  profess  and  teach  the  system  of  doctrine  contained  in  our Confession in its integrity. These men never can consent to what they believe to be immoral and destructive; and therefore any attempt to establish  this  Broad  Church  principle  of  subscription  must  tend  to produce dissension and division. Either let our faith conform to our creed,  or  make  our  creed  conform  to  our  faith.  Let  those  who  are convinced  that  the  Apostles'  Creed  is  a  broad  enough  basis  for Church organization, form a Church on that principle; but do not let them  attempt  to  persuade  others  to  sacrifice  their  consciences,  or advocate the adoption of a more extended formula of faith which is not to be sincerely embraced.</li>

<p>ON  THE  PASSAGES  OF  THE  CONFESSION  CONCERNING  THE MAGISTRATE'S POWER AS TO RELIGION AND THE CHURCH.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-editor">BY THE EDITOR.<a class="headerlink" href="#by-the-editor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>No alteration has been made by any of the Presbyterian Churches in Great  Britain  and  Ireland  on  the  substance  of  the  Confession  of Faith. In various ways, however, they have given explanations of the sense in which they adhere to those passages in it on which doubts have  been  entertained  as  to  their  consistency  with  the  rights  of conscience and the independence of the Church. The three passages on  which  the  difficulty  turns  are  given  on  pages  22-23,  with  the modifications  to  which  the  American  Presbyterians  have  subjected them.  As  the  document  itself  contains  the  noblest  assertion  of  the rights  of  conscience  (WCF  20.2),  and  was  prepared  by  a  venerable Assembly, composed of men singularly distinguished for theological attainments, and summoned in aid of a great movement for public freedom, reluctance has been felt by the British Churches to affirm that any of the passages referred to is incapable of reconciliation with the assertion of Christian liberty made in the Confession, as well as with  the  claim  put  forth  in  it  on  behalf  of  the  Church,  that  its government is "in the hand of church officers, distinct from the civil magistrate," so that "there is no other head of the Church but Jesus Christ,"  [WCF  25.6]  and  "the  civil  magistrate  may  not  assume  to himself the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven." [WCF 23.3] It  was  presumed  that  some  principle  might  exist  by  which  any seeming inconsistency between these declarations and the passages supposed to be at variance with the rights of individual conscience and  the  liberties  of  the  Church  could  be  explained  and  removed. Various explanations, indeed, to this effect have been offered. As a link connecting the modern Church with the past, and constituting a bond of union with Presbyterians of all countries-for it is remarkable how universally Presbyterian Churches of British origin, in all lands, and in spite of all divisions, have held to the Westminster Confession of Faith-there has always been an unwillingness evinced to tamper to any extent with the substance of the document itself.</p>
<p>Not that the unwillingness arose from any superstitious deference to it. On the contrary, the right to examine and revise it has at all times been  claimed  and  exercised,  to  the  effect  of  issuing  important explanations  and  qualifications  of  it.  In  the  very  Act  passed  in approval of the Confession of Faith by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in AD 1647, the following explanation is given of the  sense  in  which  the  Assembly  understood  and  held  binding  one portion of the Confession:-"It is further declared, That the Assembly understandeth  some  parts  of  the  second  article  of  the  thirty-one chapter only of kirks not settled, or constituted in point of government: And that although, in such kirks, a synod of ministers, and other fit persons, may be called by the magistrate's authority and nomination, without any other call, to consult and advise with about matters of religion; and although, likewise, the ministers of Christ, without delegation from their churches, may of themselves, and by virtue of their office, meet together synodically in such kirks not yet constituted, yet neither of these ought to be done in kirks constituted and  settled;  it  being  always  free  to  the  magistrate  to  advise  with synods of ministers and ruling elders, meeting upon delegation from their churches, either ordinarily, or, being indicted by his authority, occasionally, and pro re nata; it being also free to assemble together synodically,  as  well  pro  re  nata  as  at  the  ordinary  times,  upon delegation from the churches, by the intrinsical power received from Christ,  as  often  as  it  is  necessary  for  the  good  of  the  church  so  to assemble,  in  case  the  magistrate,  to  the  detriment  of  the  Church, withhold or deny his consent; the necessity of occasional assemblies being first remonstrate unto him by humble supplication."</p>
<p>As the result of various discussions on the subject of the relation of civil magistracy to religion and the Church, the Formula used in the United Presbyterian Church, in the ordination of ministers, missionaries,  and  elders,  has  been  couched  in  the  following  terms: -"Do you acknowledge the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms as an exhibition of the sense in which you understand the Holy Scriptures; it being understood that you are not  required  to  approve  of  anything  in  these  documents  which teaches,  or  is  supposed  to  teach,  compulsory  or  persecuting  and intolerant principles in religion?"</p>
<p>It  is  also  in  connection  with  the  questions  of  the  Formula  that  the Free Church guards itself against misconstruction on this point. In an Act of Assembly AD 1846, "Anent Questions and Formula," it is declared-"The General Assembly, in passing this Act, think it right to declare that, while the Church  firmly maintains the same scriptural  principles  as  to  the  duties  of  nations  and  their  rulers  in reference to true religion and the Church of Christ, for which she has hitherto contended, she disclaims intolerant or persecuting principles,  and  does  not  regard  her  Confession  of  Faith,  or  any portion thereof, when fairly interpreted, as favouring intolerance or persecution,  or  consider  that  her  office-bearers,  by  subscribing  it, profess any principles inconsistent with liberty of conscience and the right of private judgment." One of the questions in the Formula itself contains the following clauses:-"Do you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ,  as  King  and  Head  of  the  Church,  has  therein  appointed  a government in the hands of church officers, distinct from, and not subordinate  in  its  own  province  to,  civil  government;  and  that  the civil government  does  not  possess  jurisdiction  or  authoritative control over the regulation of the affairs of Christ's Church?"</p>
<p>The course adopted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church is different.</p>
<p>This  Church  gives  force  to  the  Act  AD  1647,  but,  in  addition,  by means of a Testimony, specified in its Terms of Communion and in the  Formula  for  Ordination  as  an  authoritative  illustration  of  the principles  of  the  Church,  it  makes  an  application  of  the  doctrines contained in the Confession, and gives a full exhibition of the sense in  which  it  adheres  to  them;  declaring  that  it  is  "not  pledged  to defend every sentiment or expression," and explicitly asserting that "to employ civil coercion of any kind for the purpose of inducing men to renounce an erroneous creed or to espouse and profess a sound, scriptural one, is incompatible with the nature of true religion, and must ever prove ineffectual in practice." In reference to the disputed and doubtful passages in the Confession, this Testimony lays stress on  the  obligation  to  interpret  and  explain  them  by  the  clearer statements in the document, which assert the claims and protect the interests of religious and civil freedom.</p>
<p>The  United  Original  Secession  Church  likewise  avails  itself  of  its Testimony  in  order  to  explain  its  views  on  this  subject.  In  the Historical Part of that Testimony, the following appears as the sixth general  proposition:  "6th,  That  the  doctrine  respecting  civil  rulers contained in the Confessions of the Reformed  Churches,  and particularly in the Westminster Confession, can be defended on the principles of Scripture and reason above stated. Whatever sense may be imposed on some expressions in it, taken by themselves, yet, upon a fair and candid interpretation of the whole doctrine which it lays down  upon  the  subject,  the  Westminster  Confession  will  not  be found justly chargeable with countenancing persecution for conscience'  sake,  with  subjecting  matters  purely  religious  to  the cognizance of the civil magistrate, or with allowing him a supremacy over the Church, or any power in it."</p>
<p>The main body of the American Presbyterians-as will be seen from the  Introduction  to  this  work  (page  21)-take  the  direct  method  of solving all difficulty and escaping all misconstruction by the deletion of one clause and the alteration of two paragraphs in the Confession of Faith.</p></div>
