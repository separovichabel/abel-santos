# Chapter 1: Of the Holy Scripture

## SECTION  I.
> Although  the  light  of  nature;  and  the  works  of creation; and providence; do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and  power  of  God,  as  to  leave  men  unexcusable;  yet  are  they  not sufficient  to  give  that  knowledge  of  God  and  of  His  will,  which  is necessary  unto  salvation.  Therefore  it  pleased  the  Lord,  at  sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal; Himself, and to declare; that His will unto His Church; and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth,  and  for  the  more  sure  establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the  malice  of  Satan  and  of  the  world,  to  commit  the  same  wholly unto writing: which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now ceased.

This section affirms the following propositions:

1. That the light of nature and the works of creation and providence are  sufficient  to  make  known  the  fact  that  there  is  a  God,  and somewhat of his nature and character, so as to leave the disobedience of men without excuse.
2. That  nevertheless  the  amount  and  kind  of  knowledge  thus attainable is not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.
3.  That  consequently  it  has  pleased  God,  of  his  sovereign  grace,  to make,  in various ways  and  at different times, a supernatural revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the human family.  
4.  And  that  subsequently  God  has  been  pleased  to commit  that  revelation  to  writing,  and  that  it  is  now  exclusively embraced in the Sacred Scriptures.

### 1.
**The light of nature and the works of creation and providence are sufficient to enable men to ascertain the fact that there is a God, and somewhat  of  his  nature  and  character,  end  thus  render  them inexcusable.**

Three generically distinct false opinions have been entertained with respect  to  the  capacity  of  men,  in  their  present  circumstances,  to attain to any positive knowledge of the being and character of God.

**(1.)**  There  is  the  assumption  of  all  those  extreme  Rationalists  who deny the existence of any world beyond the natural one discoverable by  our  senses,  and  especially  of  that  school  of  Positive  Philosophy inaugurated by Auguste Comte in France, and represented by John Stuart  Mill  and  Herbert  Spencer  in  England,  who  affirm  that  all possible human knowledge is confined to the facts of our experience and the uniform laws which regulate the succession of those facts; that it is not possible for the human mind, in its present state, to go beyond the simple order of nature to the knowledge of an absolute First  Cause,  or  to  a  designing  and  disposing  Supreme  Intelligence, even though such an one actually exists; that whether there be a God. or not, yet as a matter of fact he is not revealed, and as a matter of principle  could  not,  even  if  revealed,  be  recognized  by  man  in  the present state of his faculties.

This  assumption  is  disproved 
- **(a.)**  By  the  fact  that  men  of  all nations, ages, and degrees of culture, have discerned the evidences of the presence of a God in the works of nature and providence, and in the inward workings of their own souls. This has been true, not only of individuals, communities, or generations unenlightened by science,  but  pre-eminently  of  some  of  the  very  first  teachers  of positive  science  in  the  modern  scientific  age,  such  as  Sir  Isaac Newton, Sir David Brewster, Dr. Faraday, etc. 
- **(b.)** By the fact that the works  of  nature  and  providence  are  full  of  the  manifest  traces  of design, and that they can be scientifically explained, and as a matter of  fact  are  explained  by  these  very  sceptics  themselves, only by the recognition and accurate tracing out of the evident " intention" which each of these works is adapted to subserve in their mutual relations. 
- **(c.)** The same is disproved from the fact that conscience, which is a universal  and  indestructible  element  of  human  nature,  necessarily implies  our  accountability  to  a  personal  moral  Governor,  and  as  a matter of fact has uniformly led men to a recognition of his existence and of their relation to him.

**(2.)**  An  extreme  opinion  on  this  subject  has  been  held  by  some Christians, to the effect that no true and certain knowledge of God can be derived. by man, in his present condition, from the light of nature in the entire absence of a supernatural revelation; that we are altogether dependent upon such a revelation for any certain knowledge that God exists, as well as for all knowledge of his nature and his purposes.

This opinion is disproved 
- **(a.)** By the direct testimony of Scripture. Rom.  i.  20  --  24;  ii.  14,  15.
- **(b.)**  By  the  fact  that  many  conclusive arguments for the existence of a great First Cause, who is at the same time  an  intelligent  personal  Spirit  and  righteous  moral  Governor, have been drawn by a strict induction from the facts of nature alone, as  they  lie  open  to  the  natural  understanding.  The  fact  that  this argument  remains  unanswerable  shows  that  the  process  by  which the conclusions are drawn from purely natural sources is legitimate.
- **(c.)**  All  nations, however destitute of a supernatural revelation they may have been, have yet possessed some knowledge of a God. And in the case of the most enlightened of the heathen, natural religion has given  birth  to  a  considerable  natural  theology.  We  must,  however, distinguish  between  that  knowledge  of  the  divine  character  which may be obtained by men from the worlds of nature arid providence in the exercise of their natural powers alone, without any suggestions or assistance derived from a supernatural revelation --as is illustrated  in  the  theological  writings  of  some  most  eminent  of  the heathen who lived before Christ -- and that knowledge which men in this  age,  under  the  clear  light  of  a  supernatural  revelation,  are competent to deduce from a study of nature. The natural theology of the modern Rationalists demonstrably owes all its special excellences to that Christian revelation it is intended to supersede.

**(3.)** The third erroneous opinion which has been entertained on this subject is that of Deists and theistic Rationalists -- viz., that the light of  nature,  when  legitimately  used,  is  perfectly  sufficient  of  itself  to lead  men  to  all  necessary  knowledge  of  God's  being,  nature,  and purposes. Some German Rationalists, while admitting that a supernatural revelation  has  been  given  in  the  Christian  Scriptures, yet  insist  that  its  only  office  is  to  illustrate  and  enforce  the  truths already  given  through  the  light  of  nature,  which  are  sufficient  in themselves, and need re-enforcement only because they are ordinarily  not  properly  attended  to  by  men.  But,  in  opposition  to this, the Confession teaches
### 2. 
**That the amount of knowledge attainable by the light of nature is not sufficient to enable any to secure salvation.**

This is proved to be true  
- **(1.)** From Scripture. 1 Cor. i. 21; ii. 13, 14. 
- **(2.)**  From  the  fact  that  man's  moral  relations  to  God  have  been disturbed by sin; and while the natural light of reason may teach an unfallen  being  spontaneously  how  he  should  approach  and  serve God, and while it may teach a fallen being what the nature of God may demand as to the punishment of sin, it can teach nothing by way of anticipation as to what God may be sovereignly disposed to do in the  way  of  remission,  substitution,  sanctification,  restoration,  etc. 
- **(3.)**  'From  the  facts  presented  in  the  past  history  of  all  nations destitute of the light of revelation, both before and since Christ. The truths they have  held  have  been  incomplete  and.  mixed  with fundamental  error;  their  faith  has  been  uncertain;  their  religious rites have  been  degrading,  and  their lives immoral.  The  only apparent  exception  to  this  fact is found  in  the case of some Rationalist'  in  Christian  lands;  and  their  exceptional  superiority  to others of their creed is due to the secondary influences of that system of  supernatural  religion  which  they  deny,  but  the  power  of  which they cannot exclude.

Hence, the Confession teaches in this section

### 3.
That  consequently  it  has  pleased  God,  of  his  sovereign  grace,  to make,  in  various  ways  and  at  different  times,  a  super  natural revelation of himself and of his purposes to a chosen portion of the human family. And that

### 4.
God has been pleased subsequently to commit that revelation to writing, and it is now exclusively embraced in the Sacred Scriptures.

Since,  as  above  shown,  the  light  of  nature  is  insufficient  to  enable men to attain such a knowledge of God and his will as is necessary for  salvation,  it  follows:
**(1.)**  That  a  supernatural  revelation  is absolutely necessary for man; and, 
**(2.)** From what natural religion alone teaches us of the character of God, it follows that the giving of such a revelation is in the highest degree antecedently probable on his  part.  Man  is  essentially  a  moral  agent,  and  needs  a  clearly revealed rule of duty; and a religious being, craving communion with God. In his natural state these are both unsatisfied. But God is the author of human nature. His intelligence leads us to believe that he will complete all his works and crown a religious nature with the gift of  a  religion  practically  adequate  to  its  wants.  The  benevolence  of God  leads  us  to  anticipate  that  he  will  not  leave  his  creatures  in bewilderment and ruin for the want of light as to their condition and duties. And his righteousness occasions the presumption that he will at some  time  speak  in  definite  and  authoritative  tones  to  the conscience  of  his  subjects.
**(3.)**  As  a  matter  of  fact,  God  has  given such a revelation. Indeed he has in no period of human history left himself without a witness. His communications to mankind through the first three thousand years were made in very " diverse manners"- by theophanies and audible voices, dreams, visions, the Urim and Thummim,  and  prophetic  inspiration;  and  the  results  of  these communications were diffused and perpetuated by means of tradition.

The fact that such a revelation has been made, and. that we ' have it in  the  Christian  Scriptures,  is  fully  substantiated  by  that  mass  of proof styled the " Evidences of Christianity." The main departments of this evidence are the following:

- **(a.)** The Old and New Testaments, whether the Word of God or not, bear all the marks of genuine and authentic historical records.
- **(b.)** The miracles recorded in these Scriptures are established as facts by abundant testimony; and when admitted as facts they demonstrate the religion they accompany to be from God.
- **(c.)** The same is true in all respects with regard to the many explicit prophecies already fulfilled which are contained in the Scriptures.
- **(d.)** The unparalleled perfection of the moral system they teach, and the  supernatural  intelligence  they  discover  in  adaptation  to  all human characters and conditions in all ages.
- **(e.)** The absolutely perfect excellence of its Founder.
- **(f.)**  The  spiritual  power  of  Christianity,  as  shown  in  the  religious experience  of  individuals,  and  also  in  the  wider  influence  it  exerts over communities and nations in successive generations.

For the questions concerning the Holy Scriptures as containing the whole of this revelation now made by God to men, see below.

## SECTION II.

## SECTION III. 
> The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine  inspiration,  are  no  part  of  the  canon  of  the  Scripture,  and therefore  are  of  no  authority  in  the  Church  of  God,  nor  to  be  any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.

> Luke xvi. 29, 31; Eph. ii. 20; Rev. xxii. 18, 19; 2 Tim. iii. 16. Luke xxiv. 27, 44; Rom. iii. 2; 2 Peter i. 21.

These sections affirm the following propositions:

1.  That  the  complete  canon  of  Scripture  embraces  in  the  two  great divisions of the Old and the New Testaments all the particular books here named.
2. That the books commonly called Apocrypha form no part of that canon, and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other human writings.
3. That all the canonical books were divinely inspired, and are thus given to us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.

### 1.
**The  complete  canon  of  Scripture  embraces  in  the  two  great divisions  of  the  Old  and  New  Testaments  all  the  particular  books here named.**

The Old Testament is the collection of inspired writings given by God to his Church during the Old Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace; and the New Testament is the collection of those inspired writings which  he  gave  during  the  New  or  Christian  Dispensation  of  that Covenant.

We determine what books have a place in this canon or divine rule by an  examination  of  the  evidences  which  show  that  each  of  them, severally,  was  written  by  the  inspired.  prophet  or  apostle  whose name it bears; or, as in the case of the Gospels of Mark and Luke, written under the superintendence and published by the authority of an apostle. This evidence in the case of the Sacred Scriptures is of the same  kind  of  historical  and  critical  proof  as  is  relied  upon  by  all literary  men  to  establish  the  genuineness  and  authenticity  of  any other ancient writings, such as the Odes of Horace or the works of Herodotus. In general this evidence is **(a)** Internal, such as language, style, and the character of the matter they contain; **(b)** External, such as the testimony of contemporaneous writers, the universal consent of  contemporary  readers,  and  corroborating  history  drawn  from independent credible sources.

The genuineness of the books constituting the Old Testament canon as now received by all Protestants is established as follows:

**(1.)**  Christ  and  his  apostles  endorse  as  genuine  and  authentic  the canon of Jewish Scriptures as it existed in their time. **(a)** Christ often quotes  as  the  Word  of  God  the  separate  books  and  the  several divisions  embraced  in  the  Jewish  Scriptures  --  viz.,  the  Law,  the Prophets, and. the Holy Writings or Psalms. Mark xiv. 49; Luke xxiv. 44; John v. 39. **(b)** The apostles also quote them as the Word of God; 2  Tim.  iii.  15,  16;  Acts  i.  16.  **(c)**  Christ  often  rebuked  the  Jews  for

disobeying, but never for forging or corrupting their Scriptures, Matt xxii. 29.

**(2.)** The Jewish canon thus endorsed by Christ and his apostles is the same as that we now have. **(a)** The New Testament writers quote as Scripture almost every one of the books we recognize, and no others. **(b)**  The  Septuagint,  or  Greek  translation  of  the  Hebrew  Scriptures, made in Egypt B.C. 285, which was itself frequently quoted by Christ and his apostles, embraced every book contained in our copies. **(c)** Josephus, born A.D. 37, enumerates as Hebrew Scriptures the same books  by  their  classes.  **(d)**  The  testimony  of  the  early  Christian writers  uniformly  agrees  with  that  of  the  ancient  Jews  as  to  every book.  **(e)**  Ever  since  the  time  of  Christ  both  Jews  and  Christians, while rival and hostile parties, have separately kept the same canon, and agree perfectly as to the genuineness and authenticity of every book.

The evidence which establishes the canonical authority of the several books of the New Testament may be generally stated as follows: **(a)** The early Christian writers in all parts of the world agree in quoting as of apostolical authority the books we receive, while they quote all other  contemporaneous writings only for illustration. **(b)** The early Church Fathers furnish a number of catalogues of the books received by them as apostolical, all of which agree perfectly as to most of the books, and differ only in a slight degree with reference to some last written or least generally circulated. **(c)** The  earliest  translations  of the Scriptures prove that, at the time they were made, the books they contain  were  recognized  as  Scripture.  The  Peshito,  or  early  Syriac translation, agrees  almost  entirely  with  ours;  and  the  Vulgate, prepared by Jerome A.D. 385, was based on the Italic or early Latin version,  and  agrees  entirely  with  ours.  **(d)**  The  internal  evidence corroborates the external testimony in the case of all the books. This consists  of  the  language  and  idiom  in  which  they  are  written;  the harmony in all essentials in the midst of great variety in form and circumstantials; the elevated spirituality and doctrinal consistency of all  the  books;  and  their  practical  power  over  the  consciences  and hearts of men.

### 2. 
**But the books called Apocrypha form no part of the sacred canon, and are to be regarded as of no more authority than any other human writings.**

The word Apocrypha (anything hidden) has been applied to certain ancient  writings  whose  authorship  is  not  manifest,  and  for  which unfounded claims have been set up for a place in the canon. Some of these  have  been  associated  with  the  Old  and.  some  with  the  New Testament. In this section of the Confession, however, the name is applied. principally to those spurious scriptures for which a place is claimed  in  the  Old  Testament  canon  by  the  Roman  Church.  These are Tobit, Wisdom, Judith, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, and the two books of Maccabees. They also prefix to the book of Daniel the History of Susannah,  and  insert  in  the  third  chapter  the  Song  of  the  Three Children; and add to the end of the book the History of Bel and the Dragon.

That these books have no right to a place in the canon is proved by the  following  facts:  **(1.)**  They  never  formed  a  part  of  the  Hebrew Scriptures.  They  have  always  been  rejected  by  the  Jews,  to  whose guardianship  the  Old  Testament  Scriptures  were  committed.  **(2.)** None of them were ever quoted by Christ or the apostles. **(3.)** They were never embraced in the list of the canonical books by the early Fathers;  and  even  in  the  Roman  Church  their  authority  was  not accepted by the most learned and candid men until after it was made an  article  of  faith  by  the  Council  of  Trent,  late  in  the  sixteenth century.  **(4.)**  The  internal  evidence  presented  by  their  contents disproves their claims. None of them make any claim to inspiration, while the best of them disclaim it. Some of them consist of childish fables, and inculcate bad morals.

And this section teaches

### 3. 
**That  all  the  canonical  Scriptures  were  divinely  inspired,  and  are thus given us as an authoritative rule of faith and practice.**

The books of Scripture were written by the instrumentality of men, and  the  national  and  personal  peculiarities  of  their  authors  have been evidently as freely expressed in their writing, and their natural faculties, intellectual and moral, as freely exercised in their production, as those of the authors of any other writings. Nevertheless  these  books  are,  one  and  all,  in  thought  and  verbal expression, in substance  and  form,  wholly the Word  of  God, conveying with absolute accuracy and divine authority all that  God meant them to convey, without any human additions or admixtures. This  was  accomplished  by  a  supernatural  influence  of  the  Spirit  of God acting upon the spirits of the sacred writers, called "inspiration;" which accompanied them uniformly in what they wrote; and which, without  violating  the  free  operation  of  their  faculties,  yet  directed them in all they wrote, and secured the infallible expression of it in words. The nature of this divine influence we, of course, can no more understand  than  we  can  in  the  case  of  any  other  miracle.  But  the effects are plain and certain -- viz., that all written under it is the very Word  of  God,  of  infallible  truth,  and  of  divine  authority;  and  this infallibility  and  authority  attach  as  well  to  the  verbal  expression  in which the revelation is conveyed as to the matter of the revelation itself.

The fact that the Scriptures are thus inspired is proved because they assert it of themselves; and because they must either be credited as true in this respect, or rejected as false in all respects; 'and because God authenticated the claims of their writers by accompanying their teaching  with  "signs  and  wonders  and  divers  miracles."  Heb.  ii.  4. Wherever God sends his "sign," there he commands belief; but it is impossible that he could unconditionally command belief except to truth infallibly conveyed.

- **(1.)** The Old Testament writers claimed to be inspired. Deut. xxxi. 19 -- 22; xxxiv. 10; Num. xvi. 28, 29; 2 Sam. xxiii. 2. As a characteristic fact, they speak in the name of God, prefacing their messages with a
"Thus  saith  the  LORD.  "The  mouth  of  the  LORD  hath  spoken  it." Deut. xviii. 21, 22; 1 Kings xxi. 19; Jer. ix. 12, etc.

- **(2.)** The New Testament writers introduce their quotations from the Old Testament with such formulas as, "The Holy Ghost saith," Heb. iii. 7; "The Holy Ghost this signifying," Heb. ix. 8; "Saith God," Acts ii.  17;  1  Cor.  ix.  9,  10;  "The Lord by the mouth of his servant David saith," Acts iv. 25; "The Lord limiteth in David a certain day, saying," Heb. iv. 7.

- **(3.)** The inspiration of the Old Testament is expressly affirmed in the New Testament. Luke i. 70; Heb. i. 1; 2 Tim. iii. 16; 1 Pet. i. 10 -- 12; 2 Pet. i. 21.
- **(4.)**  Christ  and  his  apostles  constantly  quote  the  Old  Testament  as infallible,  as  that  which  must  be  fulfilled.  Matt.  v.  18;  John  x.  35; Luke xxiv. 44; Matt. ii. 15 -- 23, etc.
- **(5.)** Inspiration was promised to the apostles. Matt. x. 19; xxviii. 19, 20; Luke xii. 12; John xiii. 20; xiv. 26; xv. 26, 27; xvi. 13.
- **(6.)** They claimed to have the Spirit, in fulfillment of the promise of Christ, Acts ii. 33; xv. 28; 1 Thess. i. 5; -- to speak as the prophets of God, 1 Cor. iv. 1; 1 Thess. iv. 8; -- to speak with plenary authority, 1 Cor. ii. 13; 2 Cor. xiii. 2-4; Gal. i. 8, 9. They put their writings on a level with the Old Testament Scriptures. 2 Pet. iii. 16; 1 Thess. v. 27.

## SECTION IV.
> The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.[9]

## SECTION V.
> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church  to  an  high  and  reverent  esteem  of  the  Holy  Scripture.[10] And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty  of  the  style,  the  consent  of  all  the  parts,  the  scope  of  the whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of  the  only  way  of  man's  salvation,  the  many  other  incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth  and  divine  authority  thereof,  is  from  the  inward  work  of  the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.[11]

This section teaches the following propositions:

### 1.
**That the authority of the inspired Scriptures does not rest upon the testimony of the Church, but directly upon God.**

This  proposition  is  designed  to  deny  the  Romish  heresy  that  the inspired Church is the ultimate source of all divine know ledge, and that  the  written  Scripture  and  ecclesiastical  tradition  alike  depend upon the authoritative seal of the Church for their credibility. They thus make the Scriptures a product of the Spirit through the Church; while,  in  fact,  the  Church  is  a  product  of  the  Spirit  through  the instrumentality of the Word. It is true that the testimony of the early Church  to  the  apostolic  authorship  of  the  several  books  is  of fundamental importance, just as a subject may bear witness to the identity of an heir to the crown; but the authority of the Scriptures is no  more  derived  from  the  Church  than  that  of  the  king  from  the subject who proves the fact that he is the legal heir.

### 2.
**That  the  internal  evidences  of  a  divine  origin  contained  in  and inseparable from the Scriptures themselves are conclusive.**

This is a part of the evidences of Christianity considered under sect. i. The internal marks of a divine origin in the Bible are such as -- (1.) The phenomena it presents of a supernatural intelligence: in unity of design developed through its entire structure, although it is composed  of  sixty-six  separate  books,  by  forty  different  authors, writing at intervals through sixteen centuries; in its perfect freedom from all the errors incident to the ages of its production, with regard to facts or opinions of whatever kind; in. the marvellous knowledge it exhibits of human nature under all possible relations and conditions; in  the  original  and  luminous  solution  it  affords  of  many  of  the darkest problems of human history and destiny. (2.) The unparalleled  perfection  of  its  moral  system:  in  the  exalted  view  it gives  of  God,  his  law,  and  moral  government;  in  its  exalted  yet practical and beneficent system of morality, set forth and effectively enforced; in its wondrous power over the human conscience; and in the unrivalled extent and persistence of its influence over communities of men.

### 3.
**Yet  that  the  highest  and  most  influential  faith  in  the  truth  and authority of the Scriptures is the direct work of the Holy Spirit on our hearts.**

The Scriptures to the unregenerate man are like light to the blind. They may be felt as the rays of the sun are felt by the blind, but they cannot  be  fully  seen.  The  Holy  Spirit  opens  the  blinded  eyes  and gives due sensibility to the diseased heart; and thus assurance comes with the evidence of spiritual experience. When first regenerated, he begins to set the Scriptures to the test of experience; and the more he advances, the more he proves them true, and the more he discovers of  their  limitless  breadth  and  fulness,  and  their  evidently  designed adaptation to all human wants under all possible conditions.

## SECTION  VI.
> The  whole  counsel  of  God  concerning  all  things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions  of  men.[12]  Nevertheless,  we  acknowledge  the  inward illumination  of  the  Spirit  of  God  to  be  necessary  for  the  saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word:[13] and that  there  are  some  circumstances  concerning  the  worship  of  God, and  government  of  the  Church,  common  to  human  actions  and societies,  which  are  to  be  ordered  by  the  light  of  nature,  and Christian  prudence,  according  to  the  general  rules  of  the  Word, which are always to be observed.[14]

This section teaches the following propositions:

**The  inspired  Scriptures  of  the  Old.  And  New  Testaments  are  a complete  rule  of  faith  and  practice:  they  embrace  the  whole  of whatever supernatural revelation God  now  makes  to  men,  and  are abundantly  sufficient  for  all  the  practical  necessities  'of  men  or communities.**

This  is  proved **(1.)**  From  the  design  of  Scripture.  It  professes  to lead us to God. Whatever is necessary to that end it must teach us. If any  supplementary  knowledge  is  necessary,  it  must  refer  to  it. Incompleteness in such an undertaking would be falsehood. But **(2.)** while  Christ  and  his  apostles  constantly  refer  to  Scripture  as  an authoritative  rule,  neither  they  nor  the  Scriptures  themselves  ever refer  to  any  other  source  of  divine  revelation  whatsoever.  They therefore  assume  all  the  awful  prerogatives  of  completeness.  John xx. 31; 2 Tim. iii. 15 -- 17. And **(3.)**, as a matter of fact, the Scriptures do teach a perfect system of doctrine, and all the principles which are necessary  for  the  practical  regulation  of  the  lives  of  individuals, communities, and churches. The more diligent men have been in the study of the Bible, and the more assiduous they have been in carrying out  its  instructions  into  practice,  the  less  has  it  been  possible  for them to believe that it is incomplete in any element of a perfect rule of  all  that  which  man  is  to  believe  concerning  God,  and  of  all  that duty which God requires of man.

### 2.
**Nothing  during  the  present  dispensation  is  to  be  added  to  this complete rule of faith, either by new revelations of the Spirit or by traditions of men.**

No new revelations of the Spirit are to be expected now:

1. Because  he  has  already  given  us  a  complete  and  all-sufficient rule. 
2. because,  while  the  Old.  Testament  foretells  the  new dispensation,  the  New  Testament  does  not  refer  to  any  further revelation  to  be  expected  before  the  second  advent  of  Christ:  they always  refer  to  the  "coming"  or  "appearance"  of  Christ  as  the  very next supernatural event to be anticipated. 
3. As a matter of fact, no pretended revelations of the Spirit since the days of the apostles have borne  the marks  or  been  accompanied  with  the  "signs"  of  a supernatural  revelation:  on  the  contrary,  all  that  have  been  made public --as those of Swedenborg and the Mormons  -are inconsistent  with  Scripture  truth,  directly  oppose  the  authority  of Scripture, and teach bad morals; while private revelations have been professed only by vain enthusiasts, and are incapable of verification.

Traditions  of  men  cannot  be  allowed  to  supplement  Scripture  as  a rule of faith, because: 
1. The Scriptures, while undertaking to lead men to a saving knowledge of God, never once ascribe authority to any  such  a  supplementary  rule.
2.  Christ  rebukes  the  practical observance of it in the Pharisees. Matt. xv. 3 -- 6; Mark vii. 7, 8.
3. Tradition cannot supplement Scripture, because, while the latter is definite, complete, and perspicuous, the former is essentially indeterminate,  obscure,  and  fragmentary.
4.  The  only  system  of ecclesiastical  tradition  which  pretends  to  rival  the  Scriptures  as  a rule  of  faith  is  that  of  the  Roman  Church;  and  her  traditions  are, many of them, demonstrably of modern origin. None can be traced to the apostolic age, much  less to an apostolic origin: they are inconsistent  with  the  clear  teaching  of  Scripture,  and  with  the opinions of many of the highest authorities in that Church itself in past ages.

### 3.
**Nevertheless, a personal spiritual illumination by the power of the Holy Ghost is necessary, in every case, for the practical  and  saving knowledge of the truth embraced in the Scriptures.**

This necessity does not result from any want of either completeness or clearness in the revelation, but from the fact that man in a state of nature is carnal, and unable to discern the things of the Spirit of God. Spiritual illumination differs from inspiration, therefore, 
1. In that it conveys no new truths to the understanding, but simply opens the mind  and  heart  of  the  subject  to  the  spiritual  discernment  and appreciation of the truth already objectively presented in the Scriptures; and 
2. In that it is an element in regeneration common to all the children of God, and not peculiar to prophets or apostles; and hence, 
3. In that it is private and personal in its use, and not public.

### 4. 
That, while the Scriptures are a complete rule of faith and practice, and  while  nothing  is  to  be  regarded  as  an  article  of  faith  to  be believed, or a religious duty obligatory upon the conscience, which is not explicitly or implicitly taught in Scripture, nevertheless they do not  descend  in  practical  matters  into  details,  but,  laying  down general principles, leave men to apply them in the exercise of their natural  judgment,  in  the  light  of  experience,  and  in  adaptation  to changing  circumstances,  as  they  are  guided  by the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit.

This liberty, of course, is allowed only within the limits of the strict interpretation  of  the  principles  taught  in  the  Word,  and  in  the legitimate application of those principles, and applies to the regulation of the practical life of the individual and of the Church, in detailed adjustments to changing circumstances.

## SECTION  VII.
> All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves,  nor  alike  clear  unto  all:[15]  yet  those  things  which  are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that  not  only  the  learned,  but  the  unlearned,  in  a  due  use  of  the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.

This section affirms

### 1.
That the Scriptures are in such a sense perspicuous that all that is necessary  for  man  to  know,  in  order  to  his  salvation  or  for  his practical guidance in duty, may be learned therefrom; and

### 2.
That they are designed for the personal use, and are adapted to the instruction, of the unlearned as well as the learned.

Protestants admit that many of the truths revealed in the Scriptures in their own nature transcend human understanding, and that many prophecies  remain  intentionally  obscure  until  explained  by  their fulfillment in the developments of history. Nevertheless, Protestants affirm, and Romnnists deny: **(1.)** That every essential article of faith and rule of practice may be clearly learned from Scripture; and **(2.)** That  private  and  unlearned  Christians  may  be  safely  allowed  to interpret Scripture for themselves. On the other hand, it is true that, with the advance of historical and critical knowledge, and by means of  controversies, the Church as a community has made progress in the accurate interpretation of Scripture and in the full comprehension of the entire system of truth revealed therein.

That the Protestant doctrine on this subject is true, is proved:

- **(a.)** From the fact that all Christians promiscuously are commanded to search the Scriptures. 2 Tim.iii.15 -- 17; Acts xvii. 11; John v. 39.
- **(b.)** From the fact that the Scriptures are addressed either to all men or to the whole body of believers. Deut. vi. 4 -- 9; Luke i. 3; Rom. i. 7; 1  Cor.  i.  2;  2  Cor.  i.  1;  and  the  salutations  of  all  the  Epistles  except those to Timothy and Titus.
- **(c.)** The Scriptures are affirmed to be perspicuous. Ps. cxix. 105, 130; 2 Cor. iii. 14; 2 Pet. i. 18, 19; 2 Tim. iii. 15 -- 17.
- **(d.)** The Scriptures address men as a divine law to be obeyed and as a guide to salvation. If for all practical purposes they are not perspicuous they must mislead, and so falsify their pretensions.
- **(e.)**  Experience  has  uniformly  proved  the  truth  of  the  Protestant doctrine.  Those  Churches  which  have  most  faithfully  disseminated the Scriptures in the vernacular among the mass of the people have conformed  most  entirely  to  the  plain  and  certain  sense  of  their teaching  in  faith  and  practice;  while  those  Churches  which  have locked  them  up  in  the  hands  of  a  priesthood  have  to  the  greatest degree departed from them both in letter and spirit.

## SECTION VIII. 
>The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language  of  the  people  of  God  of  old),  and  the  New  Testament  in Greek  (which,  at  the  time  of  the  writing  of  it,  was  most  generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical; [17] so as, in all controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them.[18] But, because these original tongues are  not  known  to  all  the  people  of  God,  who  have  right  unto,  and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,[19] therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,[20] that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner;[21] and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.[22]

This section teaches,

1. That the Old Testament having been originally written in Hebrew, and  the  New  Testament  in  Greek  --  which  were  the  common languages of the large body of the Church in their respective periods -- the Scriptures in those languages are the absolute rule of faith and ultimate appeal in all controversies.
2.  That  the  original  sacred  text  has  come  down  to  us  in  a  state  of essential purity.
3.  That  the  Scriptures  should  be  translated  into  the  vernacular languages of all people, and copies put into the hands of all capable of reading them.

The true text of the ancient Scriptures is ascertained by means of a careful collation and comparison of the following:

1. Ancient manuscripts. The oldest existing Hebrew manuscripts date from the ninth or tenth century. The oldest Greek manuscripts date from the fourth to the sixth century. Many hundreds of these have been  collated  by  eminent  scholars  in  forming  the  text  of  modern Hebrew  and  Greek  Testaments.  The  differences  are  found  to  be unimportant, and the essential integrity of our text is established.

2. Quotations from the apostolic Scriptures found in the writings of the  early  Christians.  These  are  so  numerous  that  the  whole  New Testament  might  be  gathered  from  the  worlds  of  writers  dating before the seventh century, and they prove the exact state of the text at the time in which they were made.
3. Early translations into other languages. The principal of these are the Samaritan Pentateuch, which the Samaritans inherited from the ten  tribes;  the  Greek  Septuagint,  B.C.  285;  the  Peshito  or  ancient Syriac version, A.D, 100; the Latin Vulgate of Jerome, A.D. 385; the Coptic of the fifth century, and others of less critical value.

## SECTION IX. 
> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture  itself:  and  therefore,  when  there  is  a  question  about  the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it  must  be  searched  and  known  by  other  places  that  speak  more clearly. [23]

## SECTION  X.
> The  supreme  judge  by  which  all  controversies  of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient  writers,  doctrines  of  men,  and  private  spirits,  are  to  be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.[24]

> [22] 2 Pet. i. 20, 21; Acts xv. 15, 16. [24] Matt. xxii..29, 31; Eph. ii. 20 with Acts xxviii. 25.

These sections teach,

1.  That  the  infallible  and  only  true  "rule"  for  the  interpretation  of Scripture is Scripture itself.
2.  That  the  Scriptures  are  the  supreme  "judge"  in  all  controversies concerning religion.

The  authority  of  the  Scriptures  as  the  ultimate  rule  of  faith  rests alone  in  the  fact  that  they  are  the  Word  of  God.  Since  all  these writings  are  one  revelation,  and  the  only  revelation  of  his  will concerning religion given by God to men, it follows: --

**(1.)** That they are complete as a revelation in themselves, and are not to  be  supplemented  or  explained  by  light  drawn  from  any  other source.  **(2.)**  That  the  different  sections  of  this  revelation  mutually supplement and explain one another. The Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures is the only adequate expounder of his own words, and he is promised to all the children of God as a Spirit of light and truth. In dependence upon his guidance, Christians are of course to study the Scriptures, using all the helps of true learning to ascertain their meaning;  but  this  meaning  is  to  be  sought  in  the  light  of  the Scriptures themselves taken as a whole, and not in the light either of tradition or of philosophy.

> "A  *rule*  is  a  standard  of  judgment;  a  *judge*  is  the  expounder  and applier of that rule to the decision of particular cases."

The  Romish  doctrine  is,  that  the  Papal  Church  is  the  infallible teacher of men in religion; that, consequently, the Church authoritatively  determines,  
- **(1.)**  What  is  Scripture;
- **(2.)**  What  is tradition; 
- **(3.)** What  is  the  true  sense  of  Scripture  and  of  tradition; and 
- **(4.)** What is the true application of that rule to every particular question of faith or practice.

The Protestant doctrine is,
- **(1.)** That the Scriptures are the only rule of faith and practice; 
- **(2.)** 
    - **(a)** **Negatively**, that there is no body of men qualified  or  authorized  to  interpret  the  Scriptures  or  to apply their teachings to the decision of particular questions in a sense binding upon their fellow - Christians; 
    - **(b)** **Positively**, that the Scriptures are the only authoritative voice in the Church; which is to be interpreted and  applied  by  every  individual  for  himself,  with  the  assistance, though  not  by  the  authority,  of  his  fellow-Christians.  Creeds  and confessions,  as  to  form,  bind  those  only  who  voluntarily  profess them;  and  as  to  matter,  they  bind  only  so  far  as  they  affirm  truly what the Bible teaches, and because the Bible does so teach.

This  must  be  true
- **(1.)**  Because  the  Scriptures,  which  profess  to teach  us  the  way  of  salvation,  refer  us  to  no  standard  or  judge  in matters of religion beyond or above themselves; and because no body of men since the apostles has ever existed, with the qualifications or with the authority to act in the office of judge for their fellows. 
- **(2.)** Because,  as  we  have  seen,  the  Scriptures  are  themselves  complete and  perspicuous.
- **(3.)** Because  all  Christians  are  commanded  to search  the  Scriptures,  and  to  judge  both  doctrines  and  professed teachers themselves. John v. 39; 1 John ii. 20, 27; iv. 1, 2; Acts xvii. 11; Gal. i. 8; 1 These. v. 21.
- **(4.)** Because all Christians are promised the Holy Spirit to guide them in the understanding and practical use of the truth. Rom. viii. 9; 1 John ii. 20, 27
