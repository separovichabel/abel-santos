<p>There  have  been  false  gods  innumerable,  and  the  title  "  god"  has been applied to angels (Ps. xcvii. 7), because of their spirituality and exalted  excellence;  and  to  magistrates  (Ps.  1xxxii.  1,  6),  because  of their authority; and Satan is called "the god of this world" (2 Cor. iv. 4), because of his usurped dominion over the wicked. In opposition, therefore,  to  the  claims  of  all  false  gods,  and  in  exclusion  of  all figurative  use  of  the  term,  it  is  affirmed  that  there  is  but  one  true God, one living God.</p>
<p>This affirmation includes two propositions: <strong>(a)</strong> There is but one God. <strong>(b)</strong> This one God is an absolute unit, incapable of division.</p>
<p>That there is but one God is proved:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1.)</strong> From the fact that every argument that establishes the being of God,  suggests  the  existence  of  but  one.  There  must  be  one  First Cause, but there is no evidence of more than one. There must be one Designing  Intelligence  and  one  Moral  Governor,  but  neither  the argument from design nor from conscience suggests more than one.</li>
<li><strong>(2.)</strong> The  creation throughout its whole extent is one system, presenting absolute unity of design, and hence evidently emanating from one Designing Intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>(3.)</strong> The same is true of the system of providential government.</li>
<li><strong>(4.)</strong> The sense of moral accountability innate in man witnesses to the unity of the source of all absolute authority.</li>
<li><strong>(5.)</strong> All the instincts and cultivated habits of reason lead us to refer the multiplicity of the phenomenal world backward and upward to a ground of absolute unity, which being infinite and absolute, necessarily excludes division and rivalry.</li>
<li><strong>(6.)</strong> The Scriptures constantly affirm this truth. Deut. vi. 4; 1 Cor. viii. 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  indivisible unity of this one  God  is  proved  by  the  same arguments.  For  an  essential  division  in  the  one  Godhead  would  in effect constitute two Gods; besides, the Scriptures teach us that the Christian Trinity is one undivided God: "I and my Father are one." John x. 30.</p>
<h3 id="2-this-god-is-a-free-personal-spirit-without-bodily-parts-or-passions">2. This God is a free personal Spirit, without bodily parts or passions.<a class="headerlink" href="#2-this-god-is-a-free-personal-spirit-without-bodily-parts-or-passions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There is a very ancient, prevalent, and persistent mode of thought, which  pervades  a  great  deal  of  our  literature  in  the  present  day, which tends to compound God with the world, and to identify him with the laws of nature, the order and beauty of creation. In one way or another he is considered as sustaining to the phenomena of nature the  relation  of  soul  to  body,  or  of  whole  to  parts,  or  of  permanent substance to transient modes. Now all the arguments that establish the being of a God agree with the Scriptures in setting him forth as a personal spirit, distinct from the world.</p>
<p>By Spirit we mean the subject to which the attributes of intelligence, feeling, and will belong, as active properties. Where these unite there is  distinct  personality.  The  argument  from  design  proves  that  the great  First  Cause,  to  whom  the  system  of  the  universe  is  to  be referred, possesses both intelligence, benevolence,  and  will, in selecting ends, and in choosing and adapting means to effect those ends. Therefore he is a personal spirit. The argument from the sense of moral accountability, innate in all men, proves that we are subject to  a  Supreme  Lawgiver,  exterior  and  superior  to  the  person  he governs; one who takes knowledge of us, and will hold us to a strict personal account. Therefore he is a personal spirit, distinct from -though intimately associated with -- the subjects he governs.</p>
<p>We know spirit by self-consciousness, and in affirming that God is a spirit --</p>
<ul>
<li>(1.)  We  affirm  that  he  possesses  in  infinite  perfection  a11  those properties  which  belong  to  our  spirits,  (a)  because  the  Scriptures affirm that we were created in his image; (b) because they attribute all these properties severally to him; (c) because our religious nature demands that we recognize them in him; (d) because their exercise is evidenced in his works of creation and providence; (e) because they were possessed by the divine nature in Christ. And --</li>
<li>(2.) We deny that the properties of matter, such as bodily parts and passions, belong to him. We make this denial --</li>
<li>(a)  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  he  does  possess  any  such properties; and, (b) because, from the very nature of matter end its</li>
</ul>
<p>affections, it is inconsistent with those infinite and. absolute perfections which are of his essence, such as simplicity, unchangeableness, unity, omnipresence, etc.</p>
<p>When the Scriptures, in condescension to our weakness, express the fact  that  God  hears  by  saying  that  he  has  an  ear,  or  that  he  exerts power by attributing to him a hand, they evidently speak metaphorically,  because  in  the  case  of  men  spiritual  faculties  are exercised  through  bodily  organs.  And  when  they  speak  of  his repenting,  of  his  being  grieved,  or  jealous,  they  use  metaphorical language  also,  teaching  us  that  he  acts  toward  us  as  a  man  would when agitated by such passions. Such metaphors are characteristic rather of the Old than of the New Testament, and occur for the most part  in  highly  rhetorical  passages  of  the  poetical  and  prophetical books.</p>

<p>The  attributes  of  God  are  the  properties  of  his  all-perfect  nature. Those are absolute which belong to God considered in himself alone --  as  self-existence,  immensity, eternity, intelligence, etc. Those are relative which characterize him in his relation to his creatures -- as omnipresence, omniscience, etc.</p>
<p>It is evident that we can know only such properties of God as he has condescended to reveal to us, and only so much of these as he has revealed. The question, then, is, What has God revealed to us of his perfections in his Word?</p>
<p><strong>(1.)</strong>  <strong>God  is  declared  to  be  infinite  in  his  being</strong>.  Hence  he  can  exist under none of the limitations of time or space. He must be eternal, and he must fill all immensity. These three, therefore, must be the common perfections of all the properties that belong to his essence: He  is  infinite,  eternal,  omnipresent  in  his  being;  infinite,  eternal, omnipresent in his wisdom, in his power, in his justice,  etc.  When God is said to be infinite in his knowledge, or his power, we mean that  he  knows  all  things,  and  that  he  can  effect  all  that  he  wills, without any limit. When we say that he is infinite in his truth, or his justice, or his goodness, we mean that he possesses these properties in absolute perfection.</p>
<p><strong>(2.)</strong>  <strong>His  immensity</strong>.  When  we  attribute  this  perfection  to  God  we mean that his essence fills all space. This cannot be effected through multiplication of his essence, since he is ever one and indivisible; nor through its extension or diffusion, like ether, through the interplanetary spaces, because it is pure spirit. The spirit of God, like the spirit of a man, must be an absolute unit, without extension or dimensions. Therefore, the entire  indivisible  Godhead  must,  in  the totality of his being, be simultaneously present every moment of time at every point of space. He is immense absolutely and from eternity. He  has  been  omnipresent,  in  his  essence  and  in  all  the  properties thereof, ever since the creation, to every atom and element of which it  consists.  </p>
<p>Although  God  is  essentially  equally  omnipresent  to  all creatures  at  all  times,  yet,  as  he  variously  manifests  himself  at different times and places to his intelligent creatures, so he is said to be peculiarly present to them under such conditions. Thus, God was present  to  Moses  in  the  burning  bush.  Ex.  iii.  2  --  6.  And  Christ promises to be in the midst of two or three met together in his name. Matt. xviii. 20.</p>
<p><strong>(3.)</strong> <strong>His eternity</strong>. By affirming that God is eternal, we mean that his duration has no limit, and that his existence in infinite  duration  is absolutely perfect. He could have had no beginning, he can have no end,  and  in  his  existence  there  can  be  no  succession  of  thoughts, feelings or purposes. There can be no increase to his knowledge, no change as to his purpose. Hence the past and the future must be as immediately  and  as  immutably  present  with  him  as  the  present. Hence his existence is an ever-abiding, all-embracing present, which is always  contemporaneous  with  the  ever-flowing  times  of  his creatures. His knowledge, which never can change, eternally recognizes his creatures and their actions in their several places in time; and his actions upon his creatures pass from him at the precise moments predetermined in his unchanging purpose.</p>
<p>Hence  God  is  absolutely  unchangeable  in  his  being  and  in  all  the modes  and  states thereof. In his knowledge,  his feelings, his purposes, and hence in his engagements to his creatures, he is the same  yesterday,  to-day,  and  for  ever.  "The  counsel  of  the  LORD standeth for  ever,  the  thoughts  of  his  heart  to  all  generations."  Ps. xxxiii. 11.</p>
<p><strong>(4.)</strong>  <strong>The  infinite  intelligence  of  God</strong>,  including  omniscience  and absolutely  perfect  wisdom,  is  clearly  taught  in  Scripture.  God's knowledge is infinite, not only as to the range of objects it embraces, but also as to its perfection. (a) We know things only as they stand related to our organs of perception, and only in their properties; God knows them immediately, in the light of his own intelligence and in their essential nature. (b) We know things successively, as they are present to us, or as we pass inferentially from the know to the before unknown;  God  knows  all  things  eternally, by one direct, allcomprehensive intuition. (c) Our knowledge is dependent; God's is independent. Ours is fragmentary; God's total and complete. Ours is in great measure transient; God's is permanent.</p>
<p>God  knows  himself  --  the  depths  of  his  own  infinite  and  eternal being,  the  constitution  of  his  nature,  the  ideas  of  his  reason  the resources  of  his  power,  the  purposes  of  his  will.  In  knowing  the resources of his power, he knows all things possible. In knowing the immutable purposes of his will, he knows all that has existed or that will exist, because of that purpose.</p>
<p>Wisdom presupposes knowledge, and is that excellent practical use which the absolutely perfect intelligence and will of God make of his infinite knowledge. It is exercised in the election of ends, general and special, and in the selection of means in order to the accomplishment of  those  ends;  and  is  illustrated  gloriously  in  the  perfect  system  of God's works of creation, providence, and grace.</p>
<p><strong>(5.)</strong> <strong>The omnipotence of God</strong> is the infinite efficiency resident in, and inseparable  from,  the  divine  essence,  to  effect  whatsoever  he  wills, without any limitation soever except such as lies in the absolute and immutable perfections of his own nature. The power of God is both unlimited in its range and infinitely perfect in its mode of action. (a) We  are  conscious  that  the  powers  inherent  in  our  wills  are  very limited.  Our  wills  can  act  directly  only  upon  the  course  of  our thoughts  and  a  few  bodily  actions,  and  can  only  very  imperfectly control these. The power inherent in God's will acts directly upon its objects, and effects absolutely and unconditionally all he intends. (b) We work  through  means;  the  effect  often  followers  only  remotely, and  our  action  is  conditioned  by  external  circumstances.  God  acts immediately,  with  or  without  means  as  he  pleases.  When  he  acts through means it is a condescension, because the means receive all their efficiency from his power, not his power from the means. And the power of God is absolutely independent of all that is exterior to his own all-perfect nature.</p>
<p>The  power  of  God  is  the  power  of  his  all-perfect,  self-existent essence.  He  has  absolutely  unlimited  power  to  do  whatsoever  his nature  determines  him  to  will.  But  this  power  cannot  be  directed against  his  nature.  The  ultimate  principles  of  reason  and  of  moral right  and  wrong  are  not  products  of  the  divine  power,  but  are principles of the divine nature. God cannot change the nature of right and  wrong,  etc.,  because  he  did  not  make  himself,  and  these  have their  determination  in  his  own  eternal  perfections.  He  cannot  act unwisely or unrighteously; not for want of the power as respects the act, but for want of will, since God is eternally, immutably, and most freely and spontaneously, wise and righteous.</p>
<p>God's omnipotence is illustrated, but never exhausted, in his works of creation and providence. God's power is exercised at his will, but there ever remains an infinite reserve of possibility lying back of the actual exercise of power, since the Creator always infinitely transcends his creation.</p>
<p><strong>(6.)</strong> <strong>The absolutely perfect goodness of God</strong>. The moral perfection of God  is one absolutely perfect righteousness. Relatively to his creatures  his  infinite  moral  perfection  always  presents  that  aspect which his infinite wisdom decides to be appropriate to the case. He is not alternately merciful and just, nor partially merciful and partially just,  but  eternally  and  perfectly  merciful  and  just.  Both  are  right; both  are  equally  and  spontaneously  in  his  nature;  and  both  are perfectly  and  freely  harmonized  by  the  infinite  wisdom  of  that nature.</p>
<p>His  goodness  includes  (a)  Benevolence,  or  goodness  viewed  as  a disposition to promote the happiness of his sensitive creatures; (b) Love, or goodness viewed as a disposition to promote the happiness of intelligent creatures, and  to regard with complacency  their excellences; (c) Mercy, or goodness exercised toward the miserable; (d) Grace, or goodness exercised toward the undeserving.</p>
<p>The  grace  of  God  toward  the  undeserving  evidently  rests  upon  his sovereign will (Matt. xi. 26; Rom. ix. 15), and can be assured to us only by means of a positive revelation. Neither reason nor conscience nor  observation  of  nature  can  assure  us,  independently  of  his  own special revelation, that he will be gracious to the guilty. Our duty is to forgive  injuries;  we  as  individuals  have  nothing  to  do  with  either forgiving or pardoning sin. That God's goodness is absolutely perfect and  inexhaustible  is  proved  from  universal  experience,  as  well  as from  Scripture.  James  i.  17;  v.  11.  It  is  exercised,  however,  not  in making the happiness of his creatures indiscriminately and unconditionally a chief end, but is regulated by his wisdom in order to  the  accomplishment  of  the  supreme  ends  of  his  own  glory  and their excellence.</p>
<p><strong>(7.)</strong>  <strong>God  is  absolutely  true</strong>.  This  is  a  common  property  of  all  the divine perfections and actions. His knowledge is absolutely accurate; his wisdom infallible; his goodness and justice perfectly true to the standard of his own nature. In the exercise of all his properties God is  always  self-consistent.  He  is  also  always  absolutely  true  to  his creatures  in  all  his  communications,  sincere  in  his  promises  and threatenings, and faithful in their fulfillment.</p>
<p>This lays the foundation for all rational confidence in the constitution  of  our  own  natures  and  in  the  order  of  the  external world, as well as in a divinely-accredited, supernatural revelation. It guarantees the validity of the information of our senses, the truth of the  intuitions  of  reason  and  conscience,  the  correctness  of  the inferences  of  the  understanding,  and  the  general  credibility  of human testimony, and pre-eminently the reliability of every word of the inspired Scriptures.</p>
<p><strong>(8.)</strong>  <strong>The  infinite  justice  of  God</strong>.  This,  viewed  absolutely,  is  the  allperfect righteousness of God's being considered in himself.  Viewed relatively, it is his infinitely righteous nature exercised, as the moral Governor of his intelligent creatures. in the imposition of righteous laws,  and.  in  their  righteous  execution.  It  appears  in  the  general administration of his government viewed as a whole, and distributively  in  his  dealing  to  individuals  that  treatment  which righteously  belongs  to  them,  according  to  his  own  covenants  and their  own  deserts.  God  is  most  willingly  just,  but  his  justice  is  no more an optional product of his will than is his self-existent being. It is an immutable principle of his divine constitution. He is "of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity." Hab. i. 13. "He cannot deny himself." 2 Tim. ii. 13. God does not make his demands just by willing them, but he wills them because they are just.</p>
<p>The infinite righteousness of his immutable being determines him to regard  and  to  treat  all  sin  as  intrinsically  hateful  and  deserving  of punishment. The punishment of sin and its consequent discouragement is an obvious benefit to the subjects of his government in general. It is a revelation of righteousness in God, and a powerful stimulant to moral excellence in them.</p>
<p>But God hates sin because it is intrinsically hateful, and punishes it because such punishment is intrinsically righteous. This is proved --</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a.)</strong> From  the  direct  assertions  of  Scripture:  "To  me  belongeth vengeance  and  recompense."  Deut.  xxxii.  35.  "According  to  their deeds, accordingly he will repay." Isa. lix. 18, "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you." 2 Thess. i. 6. "Knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death." Rom. i. 32.</li>
<li><strong>(b.)</strong>  The Scriptures teach that the vicarious suffering of the penalty due  to  his  people  by  Christ,  as  their  substitute,  was  absolutely necessary to enable God to continue " just " and at the same time " the  justifier  of  him  which  believeth  in  Jesus."  Rom.  iii.  26.  "  If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. ii. 21. "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness  should  have  been  by  the  law."  Gal.  iii.  21.  That  is,  if God  could  have,  in  consistency  with  justice,  pardoned  sinners without an expiation, " verily" he would not have sacrificed. his own Son " in vain."</li>
<li><strong>(c.)</strong>  It  is  a  universal  judgment  of  awakened  sinners  that  their  sin deserves punishment, and that immutable righteousness demands it. And this is the sentence universally pronounced by the moral sense of enlightened men with regard to all crime.</li>
<li><strong>(d.)</strong> The same changeless principle of righteousness was in culcated by  all  the  divinely  appointed  sacrifices  of  the  Mosaic  dispensation: "Almost  all  things  by  the  law  are  purged  with  blood;  and  without shedding  of  blood  is  no  remission."  Heb.  ix.  22.  It  has  also  been illustrated  in  the  sacrificial  rites  of  all  heathen  nations,  and  in  all human laws and penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(9.)</strong> The infinite holiness of God. Sometimes this term is applied to God  to  express  his  perfect  purity:  "Sanctify  yourselves,  and  be  ye holy; for I am holy." Lev. xi. 44. In that case it is an element of  his perfect  righteousness.  "  The  Lord  is  righteous  in  all  his  ways,  and holy  in  all  his  works."  Ps.  cxlv.  17.  Sometimes  it  expresses  his transcendently august and venerable majesty, which is the result of</p>
<p>all  his  harmonious  and  blended  perfections  in  one  perfection  of absolute  and  infinite  excellence:  "And  one  cried  to  another,  Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory." Isa. vi. 3.</p>
<h3 id="5-god-is-self-existent">5. God is self-existent<a class="headerlink" href="#5-god-is-self-existent" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>God is self-existent and absolutely independent, the sole support, proprietor,  and  sovereign  disposer,  of  his  creatures.  Since  God  is eternal and the creator out of nothing of all things that exist besides himself, it follows <strong>(1.)</strong> That his own being must have the cause of its existence  in  itself  --  that  is,  that  he  is  self-existent;  <strong>(2.)</strong>  That  he  is absolutely  independent,  in  his  being,  purposes,  and  actions,  of  all other beings; and <strong>(3.)</strong> That all other beings of right belong to him, and in fact  are  absolutely  dependent  upon  him  in  their  being,  and subject to him in their actions and destinies.</p>
<p>The sovereignty of God is his absolute right to govern and dispose of the world of his own hands according to his own good pleasure. This sovereignty rests not in his will abstractly, but in his adorable person. Hence  it  is  an  infinitely  wise,  righteous,  benevolent,  and  powerful sovereignty, unlimited by anything outside of his own perfections.</p>
<p>The  grounds  of  his  sovereignty  are <strong>(1.)</strong>  His  infinite  superiority. <strong>(2.)</strong> His absolute ownership of all things, as created by him. <strong>(3.)</strong> The perpetual and absolute dependence of all things upon him for being, and of all intelligent creatures for blessedness, Dan. iv. 25, 35; Rev. iv. 11.</p>
<h2 id="section-iii">SECTION III.<a class="headerlink" href="#section-iii" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one  substance,  power,  and  eternity:  God  the  Father,  God  the  Son, and God the Holy Ghost.[38] The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; [39] the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. [40]</p>
<p>[38] 1 John v. 7; Matt. iii. 16, 17; Matt. xxviii. 19; 2 Cor. xiii. 14; [39] John i. 14, 18; [40] John xv. 26; Gal. iv. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having before shown that there is but one living and true God, and that  his  essential  properties  embrace  all  perfections,  this  section asserts in addition --</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each equally that one God; and that the indivisible divine essence and all divine perfections and prerogatives belong to each in the same sense and degree.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  these  titles,  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  are  not  different names  of  the  same  person  in  different  relations,  but  of  different persons.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>That  these  three  divine  persons  are  distinguished  from  one another by certain persona1 properties, and are revealed in a certain order of subsistence and of operation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These  propositions  embrace  the  Christian  doctrine  of  the  Trinity (three  in  unity),  which  is  no  part  of  natural  religion,  though  most clearly revealed in the inspired Scriptures -- indistinctly, perhaps, in the Old  Testament,  but  with  especial  definiteness  in  the  New Testament.</p>
<h3 id="1-father-son-and-holy-ghost-are-each-equally-the-one-god-and-the-indivisible-divine-essence-and-all-divine-perfections-and-prerogatives-belong-to-each-in-the-same-sense-and-degree">1.

<p>Since there is but one God, the infinite and the absolute First Cause, his essence, being spiritual, cannot be divided. If then Father,  Son, and Holy Ghost, are that one God, they must each equally consist of that same essence. And since the attributes of God are the inherent properties of his essence, they are inseparable from that essence; and it  follows  that  if  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  consist  of  the  same numerical essence, they must have the same identical attributes in common -- that is, there is common to them the one intelligence and the one will, etc.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are full of the evidences of this fundamental truth. It has never been questioned whether the Father is God. That the Son is the true God is proved by the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1.)</strong> Christ existed before he was born of the Virgin. (a) He was with the Father "before the world was." John viii. 58; xvii. 5. (b) "He came into the world"--" He came down from heaven." John iii. 13; xvi. 28.</li>
<li><strong>(2.)</strong> All the names and titles of God are constantly applied to Christ, and to none others except to the Father and the Spirit: as Jehovah, Jer. xxiii. 6; -- mighty God, everlasting Father, Isa, ix. 6; -- God, John i. 1; Heb. i. 8; -- God over all, Rom. ix. 5; -- the true God, and eternal life, 1 John v. 20; -- the Alpha and the Omega, the Almighty, Rev. i. 8.</li>
<li><strong>(3.)</strong>  All  divine  attributes  are  predicated  of  him:  Eternity,  John  viii. 58; xvii. 5; Rev. i. 8; xxii. 13; -- immutability, Heb. i. 10, 11; xiii. 8; -omnipresence, Matt. xviii. 20; John iii. 13; -- omniscience, Matt. xi. 27; John ii. 24, 25; Rev. ii. 28; -- omnipotence, John v. 17; Heb. i. 3.</li>
<li><strong>(4.)</strong>  The  Scriptures  attribute  all  Divine  works  to  Christ:  Creation, John  i.  3  --  10;  Col.  i.  10,  17;  --  preservation  and  providential government,  Heb.  i.  3;  Col.  i.  17;  Matt.  xxviii.  18;  --  the  final judgment, John v. 22; Matt. xxv. 31, 32; 2 Cor. v. 10; -- giving eternal life, John  x. 28; --sending  the Holy  Ghost,  John  xvi. 7; --sanctification, Eph. v. 25 -- 27.</li>
<li><strong>(5.)</strong>  The  Scriptures  declare  that  divine  worship  should  be  paid  to him: Heb. i. 6; Rev. i. 5, 6; v. 11, 12; 1 Cor. i. 2; John v. 23. Men are to be baptized into the name of Jesus, as well as into the names of the Father  and  the  Holy  Ghost.  The  grace  of  Jesus  is  invoked  in  the apostolical benediction.</li>
</ul>
<p>That the Holy Ghost is the true God is proved in a similar manner.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1.)</strong>  He  is  called  God.  What  the  Spirit  says  Jehovah  says.  Compare Isa. vi. 8, 9, with Acts xxviii. 25, 26; and Jer. xxxi. 33 with Heb. x. 15, 16. To lie to the Holy Ghost is to lie to God. Acts v. 3, 4.</li>
<li><strong>(2.)</strong>  Divine  perfections  are  ascribed  to  him:  Omniscience,  1  Cor.  ii. 10,  ll;  --  omnipresence,  Ps.  cxxxix.  7;  --  omnipotence,  Luke  i.  35; Rom. viii. 11.</li>
<li><strong>(3.)</strong>  Divine  works  are  attributed  to  him:  Creation,  Job  xxvi.  13;  Ps. civ.  30;  --  miracles,  1  Cor.  xii.  9  --  11;  --  regeneration,  John  iii.  6; Titus iii. 5.</li>
<li><strong>(4.)</strong> Divine worship is to be paid to him. His gracious influences are invoked  in  the  apostolical  benediction.  2  Cor.  xiii.  14.  We  are baptized into his name. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is never forgiven. Matt. xii. 31, 32.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-these-titles-father-son-and-holy-ghost-are-not-the-names-of-the-same-person-in-different-relations-but-of-different-persons">2. These titles, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not the names of the same person in different relations, but of different persons.<a class="headerlink" href="#2-these-titles-father-son-and-holy-ghost-are-not-the-names-of-the-same-person-in-different-relations-but-of-different-persons" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Since  there  is  but  one  indivisible  and  inalienable  spiritual  essence, which  is  common  to  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost,  and  since  they have in common one infinite intelligence, power, will, etc., when we say they are distinct persons we do not mean that one is as separate from the other as one human person is from every other. Their mode of  subsistence  in  the  one  substance  must  ever  continue  to  us  a profound mystery, as it transcends all analogy. All that is revealed to us is,  that  the  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost, stand  so  distinguished and related that,--</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(1.)</strong>  They  use  mutually  the  personal  pronouns  I,  thou,  he,  when speaking to or about each other. Thus Christ continually addresses the Father, and speaks of the Father and of the Holy Ghost: "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter," John xiv. 16; "And now, 0 Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was," John xvii. 5. Thus Christ speaks of the Holy Ghost: "I will send him;" "He shall testify of me;" " Whom the Father will send in my name," John xiv. 26, and xv. 26.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(2.)</strong> That they mutually love one another, act upon and through one another, and take counsel together. The Father sends the Son, John xvii.  3;  and  the  Father  and  Son  send  the  Spirit,  Ps.  civ.  30.  The Father  giveth  commandment  to  the  Son,  John  x.  18;  the  Spirit "speaks not of himself "--" he testifies of" and "glorifies" Christ. John xv. 26; xvi. 13-15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(3.)</strong> That they are eternally mutually related as Father and Son and Spirit. That is, the Father is the Father of the Son, and the Son the Son of the Father, and the Spirit the Spirit of the Father and of the Son.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(4.)</strong> That they work together in a perfectly harmonious economy of operations  upon  the  creation;  --  the  Father  creating  and  sitting supreme in the general administration; the Son becoming incarnate in human  nature, and, as the Theanthropos, discharging the functions  of  mediatorial  prophet,  priest,  and  king;  the  Holy  Ghost making  his  grace  omnipresent,  and  applying  it  to  the  souls  and bodies of his members: the Father the absolute origin and source of life and law; the Son the revealer; the Holy Ghost the executor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There  are  a  number  of  Scripture  passages  in  which  all  the  three persons are set forth as distinct and yet as divine: Matt. xxviii. 19; 2 Cor. xiii. 14; Matt. iii. 13-17; John xv. 26, etc.; 1 John v. 7.</p>
<h3 id="3-these-three-divine-persons-are-distinguished-from-one-another-by-certain-personal-properties-and-are-revealed-in-a-certain-order-of-subsistence-and-of-operation">3. These three divine persons are distinguished from one another by certain  personal  properties,  and  are  revealed  in  a  certain  order  of subsistence and of operation.<a class="headerlink" href="#3-these-three-divine-persons-are-distinguished-from-one-another-by-certain-personal-properties-and-are-revealed-in-a-certain-order-of-subsistence-and-of-operation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The "attributes" of God are the properties of the divine essence, and therefore common to each of the three persons, who are "the same in substance," and therefore "equal in power and glory." The "properties"  of  each  divine  person,  on  the  other  hand,  are  those peculiar  modes  of  personal  subsistence,  and  that  peculiar  order  of operation,  which  distinguish  each  from  the  others,  and  determine the relation of each to the others. This is chiefly expressed to us by the personal  names  by  which  they  are  revealed.  The  peculiar personal property of the first person is expressed by the title Father. As a person he is eternally the Father of his only begotten Son. The peculiar personal property of the second person is expressed by the title  Son.  As  a  person  he  is  eternally  the  only  begotten  Son  of  the Father, and hence the express image of his person, and the eternal Word in the beginning with God. The peculiar property of the third person  is  expressed  by  the  title  Spirit.  This  cannot  express  his essence, because his essence is also the essence of the Father and the Son. It must express his eternal personal relation to the other divine persons, because he is as a person constantly designated as the Spirit of  the  Father  and  the  Spirit  of  the  Son.  They  are  all  spoken  of  in Scripture-in  a  constant  order;  the  Father  first,  the  Son  second,  the Spirit third. The Father sends and operates through both the Son and the Spirit. The Son sends and operates through the Spirit. Never the reverse in either  case.  The  Son  is  sent  by,  acts  for,  and  reveals  the Father. The Spirit is sent by, acts for, and reveals both the Father and the Son. The persons are as eternal as the essence, equal in honour, power, and glory. Three persons, they are one God, being identical in essence and divine perfections. " I and my Father are one." John x. 30.  "The  Father  is  in  me  and  I  in  him."  John  x.  38.  "He  that  hath seen the Son, hath seen the Father." John xiv. 9 -- 11.</p>
<p>The most ancient and universally accepted statement of all the points involved in the doctrine of the Trinity, is to be found in the Creed of the  Council  of  Nice,  A.D.  325,  as  amended  by  the  Council  of Constantinople, A.D. 381.</p>
