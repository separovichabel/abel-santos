<blockquote>
<p>THE distance between God and the creature is so great, that  although  reasonable  creatures  do  owe  obedience  unto  him  as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness  and  reward,  but  by  some  voluntary  condescension  on God's part, which he has been pleased to express by way of covenant. (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-2">SECTION 2:<a class="headerlink" href="#section-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>THE first covenant made with man was a covenant of works,(2)  wherein  life  was  promised  to  Adam,  and  in  him  to  his posterity,(3) upon condition of perfect and personal obedience.(4)</p>
<p>(1) Isa. 40:13-17; Job 9:32,33; 1 Sam. 2:25; Ps. 113:5,6; 100:2,3; Job 22:  2,3;  35:7,8;  Luke  17:10;  Acts  17:24,25.  (2)  Gal.  2:12.  (3)  Rom. 10:5; 5:12-20. (4) Gen. 2:17; Gal. 3:10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here  we  come  to  the  duty  which  an  intelligent  creature  owes  its Creator,  that  it  is  essential  and  inalienable  of  the  creature's  being. Moreover, the enjoyment of the creator by the creature is wholly a matter of sovereign grace, manifest to man through the conditional promises  (covenants)  of  God-the  first  of  which  concerned  Adam, wherein  the  promise  was  life  and  the  condition  perfect,  personal obedience.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The  duty  which  an  intelligent  creature  owes  to  its  Creator  is inalienable, and springs necessarily,- <strong>(1)</strong> From the absolute, imperative  obligation  which  is  of  the  essence  of  all  that  is  morally right-which  exercises  authority  over  the  will,  but  does  not  receive authority  from  it;  and  <strong>(2)</strong>  From  the  relation  of  dependence  and obligation involved in the very fact of being created. To be a created, intelligent, moral agent, is to be under all the obligation of obeying the  will  and  of  living  for  the  glory  of  the  absolute  Owner  and Governor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The very act of creation brings the creature under obligation to the Creator,  but  it  cannot  bring  the  Creator  into  obligation  to  the creature.  Creation  itself,  being  a  signal  act  of  grace,  cannot  endow the beneficiary with a claim for more grace. If God, for instance, has created a man with an eye, it may be eminently consistent with the divine attributes, and a ground of fair anticipation, that at some time he who has given eyes will also give light; but, surely, the creation of the first can lay the foundation of no right upon the part of man for the  gift  of  the  second.  And,  of  course,  far  less  can  the  fact  that  in creation God endowed men with a religious nature lay the foundation of any right on their part for the infinitely more precious gift  of  the  personal  communications  of  his  own  ineffable  love  and grace. God cannot be bound to take all creatures naturally capable of it into the intimacies of his own society. If he does so, it is a matter of infinite condescension and sovereign will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of men and angels, God has been pleased to promise this transcendent benefit upon certain conditions; which conditional promise  is  called  a  covenant.  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  this amazing gift of God's personal love and life-giving society had been offered to angels, and at the beginning was offered to the first human pair,  upon  conditions.  Some  object  that  the  conditional  promise made to Adam in the garden is not explicitly called a covenant, and that it does not possess all the essential elements of a covenant, since it  was  a  constitution  sovereignly  ordained  by  the  Creator  without consulting the will of the creature. It is a sufficient answer to these objections-<strong>(1)</strong> That although Adam's will was not consulted, yet his will was unquestionably cordially consenting to this divine constitution and all the terms thereof, and hence the transaction did embrace  all  the  elements  of  a  covenant.  <strong>(2)</strong>  That  instances  of analogous  transactions  between  God  and  men  are  expressly  styled covenants in the Bible. If God's transactions with Noah (Gen. 9:11,12) and  with  Abraham  (Gen.  17:1-21)  were  covenants,  then  was  his transaction with Adam in the garden a covenant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis of a covenant always gives the following elements: <strong>(a)</strong> Its parties. <strong>(b)</strong> Its promise. <strong>(c)</strong> Its conditions. <strong>(d)</strong> Its penalty. As to its parties, our Standards teach-</p>
<p>In the first covenant that concerned mankind God dealt with Adam as  the  representative  of  all  his  descendants.  The  parties,  therefore, are  God  and  Adam,  the  latter  representing  the  human  race.  That Adam did so act as the representative of his descendants, in such a sense that they were equally interested with himself in all the merit or  the  demerit,  the  reward  or  the  penalty,  attaching  to  his  action during  the  period  of  probation,  has  already  been  proved  to  be  the doctrine both of our Standards and of Scripture. (Ch. 6., ss. 3, 4.) As to  the  further  nature  of  this  covenant,  our  Standards  teach-The promise of it was life, the condition of it perfect obedience, and the penalty of it death. (L. Cat., q. 20; S. Cat., q. 12.)</p>
<p>This covenant is variously styled, from one or other of these several elements. Thus, it is called the "covenant of works," because perfect obedience was its condition, and to distinguish it from the covenant of grace, which rests our salvation on a different basis altogether. It is  also  called  the  "covenant  of  life,"  because  life  was  promised  on condition  of  the  obedience.  It  is  also  called  a  "legal  covenant," because it demanded the literal fulfillment of the claims of the moral law  as  the  condition  of  God's  favor.  This  covenant  was  also  in  its essence a covenant of grace, in that it graciously promised life in the society of God as the freely-granted reward of an obedience already unconditionally due. Nevertheless it was a covenant of works and of law with respect to its demands and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> That the promise of the covenant was life is proved-<strong>(a)</strong> From the nature of the penalty, which is recorded in terms. If disobedience was linked  to  death,  obedience  must  have  been  linked  to  life.  <strong>(b)</strong>  It  is taught expressly in many passages of Scripture. Paul says, Rom. 10:5, "Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which  does  those  things  shall  live  by  them."  (Matt.  19:16,17;  Gal. 3:12; Lev. 18:5; Neh. 9:29.)</p>
<p>That  the  life  promised  was  not  mere  continuance  of  existence  is plain-<strong>(a)</strong> From the fact that the death threatened was not the mere extinction of existence. Adam experienced that death the very day he ate the forbidden fruit. The death threatened was exclusion from the communion of God. The life promised, therefore, must consist in the divine fellowship and the excellence and happiness thence resulting. <strong>(b)</strong> From the fact that mere existence was not in jeopardy. It is the character, not the fact, of continued existence which God suspended upon obedience. <strong>(c)</strong> Because the terms "life" and "death" are used in the Scriptures constantly to define two opposite spiritual conditions, which depend upon the relation of the soul to God. (John 5:24; 6:4; Rom. 6:23; 11:15; Eph. 2:1-3; 5:14; Rev. 3:1.)</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> That the condition of the covenant was perfect obedience is plain from the fact-<strong>(a)</strong> That the divine law can demand no less. It is of the essence  of  all  that  is  right  that  it  is  obligatory.  James  says,  that "whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is  guilty  of  all."  James  2:10;  Gal.  3:10;  Deut.  27:26.  <strong>(b)</strong>  That  the command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, relating to a thing indifferent in itself, was plainly designed to be a naked test of obedience, absolute and without limit.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> That the penalty of this covenant was death is distinctly stated: "In the day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die." Gen. 3:17. This denoted  a  most  lamentable  state  of  existence,  physical  and  moral, and  not  the  cessation  of  existence  or  the  dissolution  of  the  union between soul and body, because-<strong>(a)</strong> It took effect in our first parents hundreds of years before the dissolution of that union. <strong>(b)</strong> Because the Scriptures constantly describe the moral and spiritual condition into  which  their  descendants  are  born,  and  from  which  they  are delivered by Christ, as a state of death. (Rev. 3:1; Eph. 2:1-5; 5:14; John 5:24.)</p>
<p>This death is a condition of increasing sin and misery, resulting from excision  from  the  only  source  of  life.  It  involves  the  entire  person, soul and body, and continues as long as the cause continues.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">SECTION 3:<a class="headerlink" href="#section-3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MAN by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second,(5) commonly called  the  covenant  of  grace:  whereby  he  freely  offers  unto  sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved;(6) and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe.(7)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-4">SECTION 4:<a class="headerlink" href="#section-4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS covenant  of  grace  is  frequently  set  forth  in  the Scripture  by  the  name  of  a  testament,  in  reference  to  the  death  of Jesus Christ the testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.(8)</p>
<p>(5)  Gal.  3:21;  Rom.  8:3;  3:20,21;  Gen.  3:15;  Isa.  42:6.  (6)  Mark 16:15,16; John 3:16; Rom. 10:6,9; Gal. 3:11. (7) Ezek. 36:26,27; John 6:44,45. (8) Heb. 9:15-17; 7:22; Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since  Adam  forfeited  for  himself  and  his  entire  race  the  original promise of life upon the condition of perfect obedience, and incurred the penalty of death attached to disobedience, it follows that, if the old  constitution  is  left  without  supplement  or  modification,  man  is lost.  If  mankind  is  to  be  saved,  there  must  be  a  new  and  gracious intervention on the part of God. And if God intervenes to save men, it must be upon a definite plan, and upon certain definitely proclaimed and accurately fulfilled conditions. That is, a new covenant must be introduced, rendering life attainable to those who are to be saved on conditions different from those offered in the preceding constitution. The question, then, relates to what is revealed in the Scriptures as to the parties to whom the promise is made, and the conditions upon which it is suspended.</p>
<p>The  Arminian  view  is,  that  Adam  having  lost  the  promise  and incurred  the  penalty  of the covenant  which  demanded  perfect obedience, Christ's death having made it consistent with the claims of absolute justice, God for Christ's sake introduces a new covenant, styled  the  covenant  of  grace,  offering  to  all  men  individually  the eternal life forfeited by Adam on the lowered and graciously possible condition of faith and evangelical obedience. According to this view, the new covenant is just as much a covenant of works as the old one was;  the  only  difference  is  that  the  works  demanded  are  far  less difficult, and we are graciously aided in our endeavors to accomplish them. According to this view, also,  faith  and  evangelical  obedience secure eternal life in the new covenant in the same way that perfect obedience did in the old covenant.</p>
<p>This view is plainly inconsistent with the nature of the gospel. The method  of  salvation  presented  in  the  gospel  is  no  compromise  of principle, no lowering of terms. Christ fulfills the old legal covenant absolutely;  and  then,  on  the  foundation  of  what  he  has  done,  we exercise faith or trust, and through that trust we are made sharers in his righteousness and beneficiaries of his grace. Faith is not a work which Christ condescends in the gospel to accept instead of perfect obedience as the ground of salvation-it is only the hand whereby we clasp the person and work of our Redeemer, which is the true ground of salvation.</p>
<p>The Calvinist view, therefore, is, that God having determined to save the  elect  out  of  the  mass  of  the  race  fallen  in  Adam,  appointed his Son to become incarnate in our nature; and as the Christ, or Godman  Mediator,  he  appointed  him  to  be  the  second  Adam  and representative head of redeemed humanity; and as such entered into a covenant with him and with his seed in him. In this covenant the Mediator assumes in behalf of his elect seed the broken conditions of the  old  covenant  of  works  precisely  as  Adam  left  them.  Adam  had failed  to  obey,  and  therefore  forfeited  life;  he  had  sinned,  and therefore  incurred  the  endless  penalty  of  death.  Christ  therefore suffered  the  penalty,  and  extinguished  in  behalf  of  all  whom  he represented the claims of the old covenant; and at the same time he rendered a perfect vicarious obedience, which was the very condition upon  which  eternal  life  had  been  originally  offered.  All  this  Christ does as a principal party with God to the covenant, in acting as the representative of his own people.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in the administration and gracious application of this covenant, Christ the Mediator offers the blessings secured by it to all men on the condition of faith-that is, he bids all men to lay hold of these blessings by the instrumentality of faith, and he promises that if they  do  so  they  shall  certainly  enjoy  them;  and  he,  as  the mediatorial Surety of his people, insures for them that their faith and obedience shall not fail.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, some Calvinist theologians have set forth the divine method  of  human  redemption  as  embraced  in  two covenants The first, styled the "covenant of redemption," formed in eternity between the Father and Christ as principal, providing for the salvation  of  the  elect;  the  second,  styled  the  "covenant  of  grace," wherein  life  is  offered  to  all  men  on  the  condition  of  faith,  and secured to the elect through the agency of Him who, as "surety of the new covenant," insures the fulfillment of the condition in their case.</p>
<p>Our Standards say nothing of two covenants. They do not mention the covenant of redemption as distinct from the covenant of grace. But evidently the several passages which treat of this subject (Conf. Faith, ch. 7., s. 3; L. Cat., q. 31; S. Cat., q. 20) assume that there is but one covenant, contracted by Christ in behalf of the elect with God in eternity,  and  administered  by  him  to  the  elect  in  the  offers  and ordinances of the gospel and in the gracious influences of his Spirit. The  Larger  Catechism  in  the  place  referred  to  teaches  how  the covenant  of  grace  was  contracted  with  Christ  for  his  people.  The Confession of Faith in these sections teaches how that same covenant is administered by Christ to his people.</p>
<p>The doctrine of our Standards and of Scripture may be stated in the following propositions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the basis of human redemption there is an eternal covenant or personal counsel between the Father, representing the entire Godhead,  and  the  Son,  who  is  to  assume  in  the  fullness  of  time  a human element into his person, and to represent all his elect as their Mediator  and  Surety.  The  Scriptures  make  it  very  plain  that  the Father and the Son had a definite understanding <strong>(a)</strong> as to who were to be saved, <strong>(b)</strong> as to what Christ must do in order to save them, <strong>(c)</strong> as to how their personal salvation was to be accomplished, <strong>(d)</strong> as to all the blessings and advantages involved in their salvation, and <strong>(e)</strong> as to certain official rewards which were to accrue to the Mediator in consequence of his obedience.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1)</strong> The Scriptures expressly declare that the Father has promised the Mediator the salvation of his seed on condition of "the travail of his soul." (Isa. 53:10,11; 13:6,7; Ps. 89:3, 4.)</li>
<li><strong>(2)</strong> Christ makes constant reference to a previous commission he had received of his Father (John 10:18; Luke 22:29), and claims a reward conditioned upon the fulfillment of that commission. (John 17:4, 5.)</li>
<li><strong>(3)</strong>  Christ  as  Mediator  constantly  asserts  that  his  people  and  his expected  glory  are  given  him  as  a  reward  by  his  Father.  (John 17:2,24.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The  promise  of  this  covenant  was-<strong>(1)</strong>  All  needful  preparation  of Christ for his work. (Heb. 10:5; Isa. 13:1-7.) <strong>(2)</strong> Support in his work. (Luke  22:43.)  <strong>(3)</strong>  A  glorious  reward  <strong>(a)</strong>  In  his  own  Theanthropic person as Mediator. (John 5:22; Ps. 110:1.) <strong>(b)</strong> In committing to his hand  the  universal  administration  of  all  the  precious  graces  and blessings of  the  covenant.  (Matt.  28:18;  John  1:12;  7:39;  17:2;  Acts 2:33.)  <strong>(c)</strong>  In  the  salvation  of  the  elect,  including  all  general  and special provisions of grace, such as regeneration, justification, sanctification,  perseverance,  and  glory.  (Titus  3:5,6;  Jer.  31:33; 32:40; Isa. 35:10; 53:10,11.)</p>
</li>

<p>The condition of this covenant was-<strong>(1)</strong> That he should be born of a woman, made under the law. (Gal. 4:4,5.) <strong>(2)</strong> That he should assume and discharge,  in  behalf  of  his  elect,  all  the  broken  conditions  and incurred  liabilities  of  the  covenant  of  works  (Matt.  5:17,18),-<strong>(a)</strong> rendering  that  perfect  obedience  which  is  the  condition  of  the promise of the old covenant (Ps. 40:8; Isa. 13:21; John 8:29; 9:4,5; Matt. 19:17), and <strong>(b)</strong> suffering the penalty of death incurred by the breaking of the old covenant, (Isa. 53:; 2 Cor. 5:21; Gal. 3:13; Eph. 5:2.)</p>

<li>
<p>Christ, as mediatorial King, administers to his people the benefits of his covenant; and by his providence, his Word, and his Spirit, he causes  them  to  become  severally  recipients  of  these  blessings, according to his will. These benefits he offers to all men in the gospel. He promises to grant them on the condition they are received. In the case of his own people, he works faith in them, and as their Surety engages  for  them  and  makes  good  all  that  is  suspended  upon  or conveyed through their agency. In the whole sphere of our experience every Christian duty is a Christian grace; for we can fulfill the conditions of repentance and faith only as it is given to us by our Surety.  All  Christian  graces  also  involve  Christian  duties.  So  that Christ at once purchases salvation for us, and applies salvation to us; commands us to do,  and  works  in  us  to  obey;  offers  us  grace  and eternal life on conditions, and gives us the conditions and the grace and the eternal life. What he gives us he expects us to exercise. What he demands of us he at once gives us. Viewed on God's side, faith and repentance  are  the  gifts  of  the  Son.  Viewed  on  our  side,  they  are duties  and  gracious  experiences,  the  first  symptoms  of  salvation begun-instruments wherewith further grace may be attained. Viewed in  connection  with  the  covenant  of  grace,  they  are  elements  of  the promise of the Father to the Son, conditioned upon his mediatorial work.  Viewed  in  relation to salvation, they are indices of its commencement and conditions sine qua non of its completion.</p>

<p>The present administration of this covenant by Christ, in one aspect, evidently bears a near analogy to a testament or will executed  only consequent upon the death of the testator. And so in one passage our translators were correct in so translating the word diaqhkh . (Heb. 9:16,17.)  But  since  Christ  is  an  ever-living  and  constantly-acting Mediator, the same yesterday, today, and forever, this word, which expresses his present administration, should in every other instance have been translated "dispensation," instead of "testament." (2 Cor. 3:6,14; Gal. 3:15; Heb. 7:22; 12:24; 13:20.)</p>

<p>THIS covenant was differently administered in the time of  the  law,  and  in  the  time  of  the  gospel;(9)  under  the  law  it  was administered  by  promises,  prophecies,  sacrifices,  circumcision,  the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come,(10) which were for that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,(11) by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the Old Testament.(12)</p>

<p>UNDER the gospel, when Christ the substance(13) was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are, the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper;(14) which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet in them it is held forth in more fullness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy, (15) to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles;(16) and is called the New Testament.(17)  There  are  not,  therefore,  two  covenants  of  grace differing in substance, but one and the same under various dispensations.(18)</p>

<p>These sections  teach  us  concerning  the  covenant  of  grace  as  it  has been manifest in both the old and new dispensations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Covenant adminstered has from the beginning remained in all essential  repsects  the  same,  in  spite  of  all  outward  changes  in  its mode and adminsitration. <strong>(1)</strong> Christ was the Savior of men before his advent, and he saved them on the same principles then as now. He was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," (Rev. 13:8); "a propitiation for the sins that are past," (Rom. 3:25; Heb. 9:15). He was promised to Adam and to Abraham as the Savior of the world. (Gen. 3:15; 17:7); 22:18. He was symbolically exhibited and typically prophesied  by  all  the  ceremonial  and  especially  by  the  sacrificial system  of  the  temple.  (Col.  2:17;  Heb.  10:1-10.)  He  was  especially witnessed to as the Savior from sin by all the prophets. (Acts 10:43.) <strong>(2)</strong> Faith was the condition of salvation under the old dispensation in the  same  sense  it  is  now.  (Heb.  2:4;  Ps.  2:12.)  The  Old  Testament believers are set up for an example to those who are called to exercise faith  under  the  New  Testament.  (Rom.  4:;  Heb.  11:)  <strong>(3)</strong>  The  same gracious  promises  of  spiritual  grace  and  eternal  blessedness  were administered then as now. (Compare Gen. 17:7 with Matt. 22:32; and Gen. 22:18 with Gal. 3:16. See, also, Isa. 43:25; Ps. 16:; 51:; 73:24-26; Ezek. 36:27; Job 19:25-27; Dan. 12:2,3.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the old dispensatio the covenant of grace was administered chiefly by types and symbolic ordinances, signifying beforehand the coming  of  Christ,  and  thus  administration  was  almost  exclusively confined  to  the  Jewish  nation  with  consstantly  increasing  fulness and  clearness-  <strong>(1)</strong>  From  Adam  to  Abraham,  in  the  promise  to  the woman  (Gen.  3:15);  the  institution  of  bloody  sacrifices;  and  the constant  visible  appearance  and  audible  converse  of  Jehovah  with his people. <strong>(2)</strong> From Abraham to Moses, the more definite promise given to Abraham (Gen. 17:7; 22:18), in the Church separated from the  world,  embraced  in  a  special  covenant,  and  sealed  with  the sacrament  of  Circumcision.  <strong>(3)</strong>  From  Moses  to  Christ,  the  simple primitive  rite  of  sacrifice  developed  into  the  elaborate  ceremonial and  significant symbolism  of  the  temple  service,  the  covenant enriched with new promises, the Church separated from the world by new  barriers,  and  sealed  with  the  additional  sacrament  of  the Passover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The present dispensation of the covenant is superior to the former one-<strong>(1)</strong>  Because  while  it  was  formerly  administered  by  Moses,  a servant, it is now administered visibly and immediately by Christ, a son in his own house. Heb. 3:5,6. <strong>(2)</strong> The truth was then partly hid, partly revealed, in the types and symbols; now it is revealed in clear history  and  didactic  teaching.  <strong>(3)</strong>  That  revelation  has  been  vastly increased,  as  well  as  rendered  more  clear,  by  the  incarnation  of Christ and the mission of the Holy Ghost. <strong>(4)</strong> That dispensation was so  encumbered with ceremonies as to be comparatively carnal; the present  dispensation  is  spiritual.  <strong>(5)</strong>  That  was  confined  to  one people:  the  present  dispensation,  disembarrassed  from  all  national organizations, embraces  the  whole  Earth.  <strong>(6)</strong> That  method  of administration  was  preparatory:  the  present  is  final,  as  far  as  the present order of the world is concerned. It will give way only to that eternal  administration  of  the  covenant  which  shall  be  executed  by the Lamb in the new heavens and the new earth, when there shall "be gathered  together  in  one  all  things  in  Christ,  both  which  are  in heaven, and which are on earth." (Eph. 1:10.) More than this is not yet made known.</p>
