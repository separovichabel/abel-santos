# Chapter Three Of God's Eternal Decree

## SECTION 1
> GOD from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass:(l) yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, (2)  nor  is  violence  offered  to  the  will  of  the  creatures,  nor  is  the liberty  or  contingency  of  second  causes  taken  away,  but  rather established.(3)

## SECTION 2
> ALTHOUGH God knows whatsoever may or can come to  pass  upon  all  supposed  conditions;(4)  yet  hath  he  not  decreed anything  because  he  foresaw  it  as  future,  or  as  that  which  would come to pass upon such conditions.(5)

> (1) Eph. 1:11; Rom. 11:33; Heb. 6:17; Rom. 9:15,18. (2) James 1:13,17; 1 John 1:5. (3) Acts 2:23; Matt. 17:12; Acts 4:27,28; John 19:11; Prov. 16:33.  (4)  Acts  15:18;  1  Sam.  23:11,12;  Matt.  11:21,23.  (5)  Rom. 9:11,13,16,18.

These Sections affirm the following propositions:

### 1 - God has had from eternity an unchangeable plan with reference to his  creatures.
As  an  infinitely  intelligent  Creator  and  providential Ruler, God must have had a definite purpose with reference to the being and destination of all that he has created, comprehending in one all-perfect system his chief end therein, and all subordinate ends and means in reference to that chief end. And since he is an eternal and  unchangeable  Being,  his  plan  must  have  existed  in  all  its elements,  perfect  and  unchangeable,  from  eternity.  Since  he  is  an infinite,  eternal,  unchangeable,  and  absolutely  wise,  powerful,  and sovereign Person, his purposes must partake of the essential attributes of his own being. And since God's intelligence is absolutely perfect and his plan is eternal, since his ultimate end is revealed to be the single one of his own glory, and the whole work of creation and providence is observed to form one system, it follows that his plan is also  single-one  all-comprehensive  intention,  providing  for  all  the means and conditions as well as the ends selected.

### 2 - The  plan  of  God  comprehends  and  determines  all  things  and events of every kind that come to pass.

- (1)  This  is  rendered  certain  from  the  fact  that  all  God's  works  of creation and providence constitute one system. No event is isolated, either in the physical or moral world, either in heaven or on earth. All  of  God's  supernatural  revelations  and  every  advance  of  human science conspire to make this truth conspicuously luminous. Hence the original intention which determines one event must also determine  every  other  event  related  to  it,  as  cause,  condition,  or consequent, direct and indirect, immediate and remote. Hence, the plan  which  determines  general  ends  must  also  determine  even  the minutest element comprehended in the system of which those ends are  parts.  The  free  actions  of  free  agents  constitute  an  eminently important and effective element in the system of things. If the plan of God did not determine events of this class, he could make nothing certain, and his government of the world would be made contingent and dependent, and all his purposes fallible and mutable.
- (2) The Scriptures expressly declare this truth-
    - (a) Of the whole system in general. He "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will" (Eph. 1:11).
    - (b) Of fortuitous events (Prov. 16:33; Matt. 10:29,30).
    - (c) Of the free actions of men. "The king's heart is in the hands of the LORD, as  the  rivers  of  water:  he  turneth  it  whithersoever  he  will" (Prov. 21:1). "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them" (Eph. 2:10). "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).
    - (d)  Of  the  sinful  actions  of  men.  "Him,  being  delivered  by  the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain" (Acts 2:23). "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  for  to  do  whatsoever  thy  hand  and  thy  counsel determined before to be done" (Acts 4:27,28). (Compare Gen. 37:28 with Gen. 45:7,8; Isa. 10:5.)

It  must  be  remembered,  however,  that  the  purpose  of  God  with respect to the sinful acts of men and wicked angels is in no degree to cause the evil, nor to approve it, but only to permit the wicked agent to perform it, and then to overrule it for his own most wise and holy ends. The same infinitely perfect and self-consistent decree ordains the  moral law which forbids  and  punishes  all  sin,  and  at  the  same time  permits  its  occurrence,  limiting  and  determining  the  precise channel to which it shall be confined, the precise end to which it shall be  directed,  and  overruling  its  consequences  for  good:  "But  as  for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive" (Gen. 50:20).

### 3 - This all-comprehensive purpose is not, as a whole nor in any of its constituent elements, conditional.
It in no respect depends upon his foresight of events not embraced in and determined by his purpose. It  is  absolutely  sovereign,  depending  only  on  the  "wise  and  holy counsel of his own will."

A very obvious distinction must always be kept in mind between an event being conditioned on other events, and the decree of God with reference  to  that  event  being  conditioned.  Calvinists  believe,  as  all men must, that all events in the system of things depend upon their causes, and are suspended on conditions. That is, if a man does not sow  seed,  he  will  not  reap;  if  he  does  sow,  and  all  the  favorable climatic  influences  are  present,  he  will  reap.  If  a  man  believes,  he shall be saved; if he does not believe, he will not be saved. But the allcomprehensive purpose of God embraces and determines the cause and the conditions, as well as the event suspended upon them. The decree, instead of altering, determines the nature of events, and their mutual  relations.  It  makes  free  actions  free  in  relation  to  their agents, and contingent events contingent in relation to their conditions;  while  at  the  same  time,  it  makes  the  entire  system  of events,  and  every  element  embraced  in  it,  certainly  future.  An absolute decree is one which, while it may  determine many conditional events by determining their conditions, is itself suspended  on  no  condition.  A  conditional  decree  is  one  which determines that a certain event shall happen on condition that some other  undecreed  event  happens,  upon  which  undecreed  event  the decree itself, as well as the event decreed, is suspended.

**The Confession in this section teaches that all the decrees of God are unconditional.**

All who believe in a divine government agree with Calvinists that the decrees of God relating to events produced by necessary causes are unconditional.  The  only  debate  relates  to  those  decrees  which  are concerned with the free actions of men and of angels. The Socinians and  Rationalists  maintain  that  God  cannot  certainly  foresee  free actions, because from their very nature they are uncertain until they are performed. Arminians admit that he certainly foresees them, but deny  that  he  determines  them.  Calvinists  affirm  that  he  foresees them to be certainly future because he has determined them to be so. The truth of the Calvinist view is proved-

- (1) From the fact that, as shown above, the decrees of God determine all classes of events. If every event that comes to pass is foreordained,  it  is  evident  that  there  is  nothing  left  undetermined upon which the decree can be conditioned.
- (2)  Because  the  decrees  of  God  are  sovereign.  This  is  evident-(a) Because  God  is  the  eternal  and  absolute  Creator  of  all  things.  All creatures  exist,  and  are  what  they  are,  and  possess  the  properties peculiar to them, and act under the very conditions in which they act,

because of God's plan. (b) It is directly affirmed in Scripture (Dan. 4:35; Isa. 40:13,14; Rom. 9:15-18; Eph. 1:5).

- (3) God's decree includes and determines the means and conditions upon  which  events  depend,  as  well  as  the  events  themselves: "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,  that  we  should  be  holy"  (Eph.  1:4).  "By  grace  are  ye  saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God" (Eph. 2:8). "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" (2 Thess. 2:13). In the case of Paul's shipwreck, God first promised Paul absolutely that not a life should be lost (Acts 27:24). But Paul said, verse 31, "Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
- (4) The  Scriptures  declare  that the salvation of individuals is conditioned upon the personal act of faith, and at the same time that the  decree  of  God  with  regard  to  the  salvation  of  individuals  rests solely upon "the counsel of his own will," "his own good pleasure." "For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil,  that  the  purpose  of  God  according  to  election  might  stand, not  of  works,  but  of  him  that  calleth,"  etc.  (Rom.  9:11).  "Being predestinated  according  to  the  purpose  of  him  who  worketh  all things  after  the  counsel  of  his  own  will"  (Eph.  1:11;  1:5;  Matt. 11:25,26).

### 4 - The purpose of God is certainly efficacious

The  decree  of  God  is  merely  a  purpose  which  he  executes  in  his works of creation and providence. When it is said that all the decrees of  God  are  certainly  efficacious,  it  is  not  meant  that  they  are  the proximate causes of events, but that they render, under the subsequent economy  of creation and providence, every event embraced in them absolutely certain. This is evident-

- (1) From the nature of God as an infinitely wise and powerful person and absolute sovereign.
- (2)  From  the  fact  that  the  decrees  relate  to  all  events  without exception, and are sovereign and unconditional.
- (3) The Scriptures declare, with reference to such events, that there is  a  needs-be  that  they  should  happen  as  it  was  determined  (Matt. 16:21; Luke 24:44; 22:22).

### 5 - This  purpose  must  in  all  things  be  perfectly  consistent  with  his own most wise, benevolent, and holy nature

This  is  a  self-evident  truth  from  the  nature  of  God  as  an  eternal, absolutely  perfect,  and  unchangeable  Being.  His  decrees  must  be absolutely perfect in wisdom and righteousness. The problem of the permission of sin is to us insoluble, because unexplained. The fact is certain,  the  reason  beyond  discovery.  If  God  be  infinitely  wise  and powerful,  he  might  have  prevented  it.  It  is evident  that it is consistent with absolute righteousness to permit it and to overrule it. The  Arminian  admits  that  God  foresaw  that  sin  and  misery  would certainly  eventuate  upon  the  conditions  of  creation  he  established. He  is  therefore  as  unable  as  the  Calvinist  is  to  explain  why  God, notwithstanding  that certain knowledge,  did not change  those conditions.

It remains certain, however, that God is not the cause of sin because He  is  absolutely  holy.  Moreover,  sin  is  essentially  defined  as  a violation of God's will (ovomia), and God cannot violate His own will. Also, having free agency we are responsible for our actions. We must assert that God has permitted sin for the purpose of overruling it in the  interests  of  righteousness  and  benevolence,  for  His  own  glory and our highest good.

### 6 - The  purpose of God is in all things perfectly consistent  with  the nature and the mode of action of the creatures severally embraced within it.

This is certain:

- (1) Because the one eternal, self-consistent, all-comprehensive

purpose of God at the same time determines the nature of the agent, his proper mode of action, and each action that shall eventuate. As God's  purpose  cannot  be  inconsistent  with  itself,  the  element  of  it determining the nature of the agent cannot be inconsistent with the element of it determining any particular action of the agent.

- (2)  Because  the  decrees  of  God  are  not  the  proximate  causes  of events; they only make a given event certainly future. It provides that free  agents  shall  be  free  agents,  and  free  actions  free  actions;  and that a given free agent shall exist, and that he shall freely perform a certain free action under certain conditions.

Now,  that  a  given  free  action  is  certainly  future,  is  obviously  not inconsistent  with  the  perfect  freedom  of  the  agent  in  that  act:  **(a)** Because  all  admit  that  God  certainly  foreknows  the  free  actions  of free agents, and if so, they must be certainly future, although free. **(b)** God's actions are certainly holy, though free; and the same is true of all  glorified  spirits  in  heaven.  **(c)**  The  actions  of  the  devil,  and  of finally reprobate men and angels, will forever be certainly wicked, yet free and responsible.

## SECTION 3: 
>BY the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels(6) are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death.(7)

## SECTION  4
> THESE  angels  and  men,  thus  predestinated  and foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.(8)

## SECTION  5
> THOSE  of  mankind  that  are  predestinated  unto  life, God,  before  the  foundation  of  the  world  was  laid,  according  to  his eternal  and  immutable  purpose,  and  the  secret  counsel  and  good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory,(9) out of his mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto;(10) and all to the praise of his glorious grace.(11)

The preceding sections having affirmed that the eternal, sovereign, immutable,  unconditional  decree  of  God  determines  all  events  of every  class  that  come  to  pass,  these  sections  proceed  to  affirm,  by way of specification, the following propositions:

### 1 
The  decree  of  God  determines  that  out  of  the  mass  of  fallen humanity  certain  individuals  shall  attain  to  eternal  salvation,  and that the rest shall be left to be dealt with justly for their sins.

The Socinian holds that the free acts of men, being in  their  nature uncertain, cannot be foreknown as certainly future. Since, therefore, God  does  not  foreknow  who  will  repent  and  believe,  his  election amounts to no more than his general purpose to save all believers as a class.

The Arminian holds that God, foreseeing from all eternity who will repent  and  believe,  elects  those  individuals  to  eternal  life  on  that condition of faith and repentance thus certainly foreknown.

The  Calvinist  holds  that  God  has  elected  certain  individuals  to eternal life, and all the means and conditions thereof, on the ground of his  sovereign  good  pleasure.  He  chooses  them  to  faith  and repentance, and not because of their faith and repentance. That God does choose individuals to eternal life is certain.

- **(1)** The subjects are always spoken of in Scripture as individuals: "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48; 2 Thess. 2:13; Eph. 1:4).
- **(2)** The names of the elect are said to be "written in heaven," and to be "in the book of life" (Phil. 4:3; Heb. 12:23).
- **(3)**  The  blessings  to  which  men  are  elected  are  such  as  pertain  to individuals, not to communities; and they are represented as elected to these spiritual qualifications, and not because they belong to the class which possesses them. They are elected "to salvation," "to the adoption of sons," "to be holy and without blame before him in love" (2 Thess. 2:13; Gal. 4:4,5; Eph. 1:4).

### 2
This election is unchangeable. This is self-evident.

### 3
It is not conditioned upon foreseen faith or repentance, but in each case upon sovereign grace and personal love, according to the secret counsel of his will.
- (1) It is expressly declared not to rest upon works; but foreseen faith and repentance are works (Rom. 11:4-7; 2 Tim. 1:9).
- (2)  Faith  and  repentance  are  expressly  said  to  be  the  fruits  of election,  and  consequently  cannot  be  its  conditions.  They  are  also declared  to  be  the  gifts of God,  and  cannot  therefore  be  the conditions  upon  which  he  suspends  his  purpose  (Eph.  2:10;  1:4;  1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 2:8; Acts 5:31; 1 Cor. 4:7). "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that  of  all  which  he  hath  given  me  I  should  lose  nothing"  (John 6:37,39). "But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep" (John 10:26). "And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48).
- (3)  The  Scriptures  represent  men  by  nature  as  "dead  in  trespasses and  sins";  and  faith  and  repentance  as  the  exercise  of  regenerated souls;  and  regeneration  as  the  work  of  God-a  "new  birth,"  a  "new creation,"  a  "quickening  from  the  dead."  Faith  and  repentance, therefore,  must  be  conditioned  upon  God's  purpose,  and  cannot condition it (Eph. 2:1; John 3:3,5; Eph. 2:5,10).
- (4) The Scriptures expressly say that election is conditioned on the "good  pleasure  of  God's  will":  "Having  predestinated  us  unto  the adoption  of  children  by  Jesus  Christ  to  himself,  according  to  the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace...In whom  also  we  have  obtained  an  inheritance,  being  predestinated according  to  the  purpose  of  him  who  worketh  all  things  after  the counsel of his own will" (Eph. 1:5,11; Matt. 11:25,26; John 15:16,19).
- (5)  God claims the right of sovereign, unconditional election as his prerogative:  "Hath  not  the  potter  power  over  the  clay,  of  the  same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?" (Rom. 9:21). If of the same lump, the difference is not in the clay. "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy" (Rom. 9:16).

### 4
The ultimate end or motive of God in election is the praise of his glorious  grace.  This  is  expressly  asserted  in  Eph.  1:5,6,12.  In  the chapter on Creation it will be shown that the final end of God in all his works, as a whole, is the manifestation of his own glory. If it be the  final  end  of  the  whole,  it  must  be  the  end  also  of  the  special destination of all the parts.

## SECTION 6
> AS God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto.(12) Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ;(13) are effectually called unto faith in Christ  by  his  Spirit  working  in  due  season;  are  justified,  adopted, sanctified,(14)  and  kept  by  his  power  through  faith  unto  salvation. (15)  Neither  are  any  other  redeemed  by  Christ,  effectually  called, justified, adopted, sanctified and saved, but the elect only.(16)

> Scripture Proof Texts
>(12) 1 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:4,5; 2:10; 2 Thess. 2:13. (13) 1 Thess. 5:9,10; Tit. 2:14. (14) Rom. 8:30; Eph. 1:5; 2 Thess. 2:13. (15) 1 Pet. 1:5. (16) John 17:9; Rom. 8:28; John 6:64,65; 10:26; 8:47; 1 John 2:19.

This section affirms:

1. That although the decree of God is one eternal, all-comprehensive intention, the several elements embraced  within  it necessarily sustain the relation to one another of means to ends. In determining the ends he intends to accomplish, God at the same time determines the  means  by  which  he  intends  to  accomplish  them.  And  God's purpose  with  respect  to  the  end  necessarily,  in  the  logical  order, takes precedence of and gives direction to his purpose with respect to the means.
2. That, in the matter of the redemption of men, the end which God determined  was  the  salvation  of  certain  individuals,  called  "the elect"; and that he appointed, as means to that end, redemption by Christ, effectual calling, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance in grace unto death.
3. That as the means are intended to effect the end, so they are not to be exercised in the case of any whose salvation has not been adopted as that end. None but the elect are redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, or justified, or adopted, or sanctified.

### 1
**That the purposes of God do sustain the relation to one another of means to ends is evident**
- (1)  From  the  fact  that  his  purposes  are  the  product  of  an  infinite intelligence the very office of which is to coordinate a great system of means in the accomplishment of a great design.
- (2) God accomplishes his eternal purposes in his works of creation and  providence,  and  in  the  economy  of  both  he  habitually  uses systems of means in subordination to predetermined ends.
- (3) All the events decreed as a matter of fact eventuate in the relation of  means in subordination to ends. They must therefore have been embraced in the same order in the divine decree.
- (4)  God explicitly  tells  us  that  he  determines  one  thing  in  order  to accomplish  another.  He  predestinates  men  to  salvation,  "through

sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth," to "the praise of the glory of his grace" (2 Thess. 2:13; Eph. 1:6).

### 2
That the gift of Christ to make atonement for sin, and of the Holy Ghost to regenerate and sanctify, are in the divine designed as means to  accomplish  his  purpose  to  secure  the  salvation  of  the  elect,  has been  doubted  by  some  theologians,  but  is  explicitly  affirmed  both positively and negatively in this section of the Confession. In the time that this Confession was written, the phrase "to redeem" was used in the same sense in which we now use the phrase "to make atonement for." The  Confession affirms, first, positively, that Christ was eternally appointed to make atonement as a means of executing the purpose to save the elect; and second, negatively, that he has made atonement  for  none  others.  The  class  of  theologians  who  do  not agree  with  the  Confession  at  this  point,  view  the  purposes  of  God, with respect to man's salvation and the gift of Christ to be a Savior, as sustaining respectively the following order: Out of infinite pity and universal benevolence, God determined to give his Son to die for the redemption from the curse of the law of all mankind, ruined by the fall; but, foreseeing that if left to themselves all men would certainly reject Christ and be lost, God, in order to carry out and apply his plan of  human  redemption,  and  moved  by  a  special  love  to  certain persons, elected them out of the mass of mankind to be recipients of the special effectual grace of the Holy Ghost, and thus to salvation. The doctrine taught in the Confession and held by the great body of the  Reformed  Churches  is,  that  God,  moved  by  a  special  personal love,  elected  certain  men  out  of  the  mass  of  the  fallen  race  to salvation, and in order to accomplish that purpose he determined to send Christ to die for them and the Holy Ghost to renew and sanctify them. That the view of the Confession is the true one is plain-

- (1) From the very statement of the case. The gift of Christ to die for the elect is a very adequate means to accomplish the decree of their salvation. But, on the other hand, the decree to give the efficacious influences  of  the  Holy  Ghost  only  to  the  elect  is  a  very  inadequate means  of  accomplishing  the  purpose  of  redeeming  all  men  by  the sacrifice of Christ. A purpose to save all and a purpose to save only some could not coexist in the divine mind.

- (2) All the purposes of God, being unchangeable, self-consistent, and certainly efficacious, must perfectly correspond to the events which come to pass in time. He must have predestinated to salvation those and those only who are as a matter of fact saved; and he must have intended  that  Christ  should  redeem  those  and  those  only  who  are redeemed.  God's  purpose  in  the  gift  of  Christ  cannot  be  in  any respect in vain. (3) Christ says explicitly, "I lay down my life for the sheep" (John 10:15).

### 3
None but the elect are redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, or justified, or adopted, or sanctified.

This  is  only  the  negative  statement  of  the  same  truth,  designed  to make the positive affirmation of it the more explicit and emphatic.

The doctrine as to the design of God in the sacrifice of Christ is stated again in  Chapter  8.  Section  8.  of  the  Confession,  and  will  be  more appropriately stated and discussed in that place.

## SECTION 7
>THE rest of mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable  counsel  of  his  own  will,  whereby  he  extendeth  or withholdeth  mercy  as  he  pleaseth,  for  the  glory  of  his  sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.(17)

> Scripture Proof Texts
>(17)  Matt.  11:25,26;  Rom.  9:17,18,21,22;  2  Tim.  2:19,20;  Jude  4;  1 Pet. 2:8.

This section teaches the following propositions:

- 1. That as God has sovereignly destinated certain persons, called the elect,  through  grace  to  salvation,  so  he  has  sovereignly  decreed  to withhold  his  grace  from  the  rest;  and  that  this  withholding  rests upon the unsearchable counsel of his own will, and is for the glory of his sovereign power.
- 2.  That  God  has  consequently  determined  to  treat  all  those  left  in their  sins  with  exact  justice  according  to  their  own  deserts,  to  the praise of his justice, which demands the punishment of all unexpiated sin.

This decree of reprobation, as it is called, is the aspect which God's eternal purpose presents in its relation to that portion of the human family which shall be finally condemned for their sins.

Reprobation consists of two elements, the negative and the positive. In its negative aspect God does not elect the reprobate, but "passes over" him; in this God is absolutely sovereign, resting upon His good pleasure  alone,  since  those  passed  over  are  no  worse  than  those elected. Positively, reprobation is not sovereign, but purely judicial, since God has determined to treat the reprobate according to what they deserve.

This  doctrine,  instead  of  being  inconsistent  with  the  principles  of absolute  justice,  necessarily  follows  from  the  application  of  those principles to the case in hand.

- (1)  All  men  alike  are  "by  nature  the  children  of  wrath,"  and  justly obnoxious to the penalty of the law antecedently to the gift of Christ to  be  their  Savior.  It  is  because  they  are  in  this  condition  that vicarious  satisfaction  of  divine  justice  was  absolutely  necessary  in order to the salvation of any, otherwise, the apostle says, "Christ is dead in  vain."  Hence  if  any  are  to  be  saved,  justice  itself  demands that  their  salvation  shall  be  recognized  as  not  their  right,  but  a sovereign concession on the part of God. None have a natural right to salvation. And the salvation of one cannot give a right to salvation to another.
- (2) Salvation is declared to be in its very essence a matter of grace; and if of grace, the selection of its subjects is inalienably a matter of divine discretion (Lam. 3:22; Rom. 4:4; 11:6; Eph. 1:5-7; John 3:16; 1 John 3:16; 4:10).

This doctrine as above stated is true:

- (1)  Because  it  is  necessarily  involved  in  the  scriptural  doctrine  of election taught in the preceding sections.
- (2) It is expressly taught in Scripture: "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth" (Rom. 9:18; 1 Pet. 2:8; Rev. 13:8; Jude 4).
- (3) God asserts the right involved as his righteous prerogative: "Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? Who art thou that repliest against God? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same  lump  to  make  one  vessel  unto  honour,  and  another  unto dishonour? What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the riches of his glory  on  the  vessels  of  mercy,  which  he  had  afore  prepared  unto glory?" (Rom. 9:19-23).

### SECTION 8
>THE doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care,(18) that men attending  the  will of God  revealed  in  his  Word,  and  yielding obedience  thereunto,  may,  from  the  certainty  of  their  effectual vocation,  be  assured  of  their  eternal  election.(19)  So  shall  this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of God, (20) and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation, to all that sincerely obey the gospel.(21)

> Scripture Proof Texts
> (18) Rom. 9:20; 11:33; Deut. 29:29. (19) 2 Pet. 1:10. (20) Eph. 1:6; Rom. 11:33. (21) Rom. 11:5,6,20; 2 Pet. 1:10; Rom. 8:33; Luke 10:20.

This section teaches that the high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special prudence and care. This necessity arises from the  fact  that  it  is  often  abused,  and  that  its  proper  use  is  in  the highest degree important.

The  principle  of  divine  sovereignty  in  the  distribution  of  grace  is certainly revealed in Scripture, is not difficult of comprehension; and is of  great  practical  use  to  convince  men  of  the  greatness  and independence of God, of the certain efficacy of his grace and security of his promises, and of their own sin and absolute dependence. But the  philosophy  of  the  relation  of  his  sovereign  purpose  to  the  free agency  of  the  creature,  and  to  the  permission  of  moral  evil,  is  not revealed  in  the  Scriptures,  and  cannot  be  discovered  by  human reason,  and  therefore  ought  not  to  be  rashly  meddled  with.  This truth ought not, moreover, to be obtruded out of its due place in the system, which includes the equally certain truths of the freedom of man and the free offers of the gospel to all.

While the principle of sovereign election as lying at the foundation of all  grace  is  thus  clearly  revealed,  the  election  or  nonelection  of particular  persons is  not  revealed  in  the  Scriptures.  The  preceptive and not the decretive will of God is the rule of human duty. Election is first with God, and grace consequent upon it. But with man duty and  grace  are  first,  and  the  inference  of  personal  election  only consequent  upon  the  possession  of  grace.  The  command  to  repent and  believe  is addressed  to  all men  indiscriminately,  and  the obligation  rests  equally  upon  all.  The  concern  of  the  inquirer  is simply  with  the  fact  that  the  grace  is  offered,  and  assured  to  him upon  condition  of  acceptance,  and  with  his  duty  to  accept  and improve it. Afterward it is the great privilege of the believer to make the  fact  of  his  eternal  calling  and  election  sure,  by  adding  to  faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge etc.; for if he do these things he shall never fall (2 Pet. 1:5-10).
