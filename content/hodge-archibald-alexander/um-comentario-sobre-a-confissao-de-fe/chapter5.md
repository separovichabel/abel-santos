# Chapter 5: Of Providence

## SECTION 1:  
> GOD,  the  great  Creator  of  all  things,  doth  uphold,(1) direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, actions, and things,(2) from the greatest even  to the least,(3) by his most  wise  and  holy providence,(4) according to his infallible foreknowledge,(5) and the free and immutable counsel of his own will,(6) to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy.(7)

Since  the  eternal  and  immutable  purpose  of  God  has  certainly predetermined  whatsoever  comes  to  pass,  it  follows  that  he  must execute  his  own  purpose  not  only  in  his  works  of  creation,  but likewise  in  his  continual  control  of  all  his  creatures  and  all  their actions. This section therefore teaches:

- 1.  That  God  having  created  the  substances  of  which  all  things  are composed out of nothing, having endued these substances with their respective properties and powers, and having out of them formed all things organic and inorganic, and endowed them severally with their respective properties and faculties, he continues to sustain them in being and in the possession and exercise of those properties during the entire period of their existence.
- 2. That God directs all the actions of his creatures according to their respective properties and relations.
- 3.  That  his  providential  control  extends  to  all  his  creatures  and  all their actions of every kind.
- 4.  That  his  providential  control  is  in  all  respects  the  consistent execution of his eternal, immutable, and sovereign purpose.
- 5. That the final end of his providence is the manifestation of his own glory.
- 1.  With  regard  to  the  question  how  God  is  concerned  in  upholding and  preserving  the  things  he  has  made,  three  different  classes  of opinion have prevailed:
- (1)  Deists  and  Rationalists  generally  regard  God  as  sustaining  no other relation to his works than that of the first of a series of causes and  effects. He  is supposed  to  touch  the  creation  only  at  its commencement, and having given to things a permanent independent  being  exterior  to himself, he leaves them  to the unmodified exercise of their own faculties.
- (2) Pantheists regard all the phenomena of the universe of every kind as  merely  the  various  modes  of  one  universal  absolute  substance. The  substance  is  one,  the  modes  many;  the  substance  abides,  the modes rapidly succeed each other; the substance is God, the modes we call things. Some true Christian theologians have taken a view of the  relation  of  God  to  the  world  which  comes  perilously  near,  if  it does  not  coincide  with,  this  great  Pantheistic  heresy.  This  view  is, that God's power is constantly exerted in continually creating every individual  thing  again  and  again  every  fraction  of  duration;  that created things have no real being of their own, and exist only as thus they are each moment the product of creative energy; and hence that the  immediate  cause  of  the  state  or  action  of  any  creature  one moment of time is not its state or action the previous moment, but the direct act of divine creative power.
If this be so, it is plain that God is the only real agent in the universe; that  he  is  the  immediate  cause  of  all  things,  including  all  evil passions  and  wicked  thoughts  and  acts;  that  consciousness  is  a thorough delusion, and the free agency and moral accountability of man vain imaginations.

- (3) The third view is the true one, and it stands intermediate between the two above stated extremes. It may be stated as follows-
    - (a) God gave to all substances, both material and spiritual, a real and permanent existence as entities.
    - (b) They really possess all such active and passive properties as God has severally endued them with.
    - (c) These  properties  have  a  real  and  not  merely  an apparent efficiency as second causes in producing the effects proper to them.
    - (d) But these created substances, although possessing a real existence exterior to God, and exerting real efficiency as causes, are not self-existent; that is, the ground of their continued existence is in God and not in them. Though not to be confounded with God, they are  not  to  be  separated  from  him,  but  "in  him  live  and  move,  and have all their being."
    - (e) The precise nature of the exercise of divine energy whereby God interpenetrates  the  universe  with  his  presence,  embraces  it  and  all things  therein  in  his  power,  and  upholds  them  in  being,  is  not revealed, and of course is indiscoverable.

That God always continues to exert his almighty power in upholding in  being  and  in  the  possession  and  use  of  their  endowments  all things he has made is proved-

- (1) From the fact that continued dependence is inseparable from the idea  of  a  creature.  The  abiding  cause  of  the  creature's  continued existence must ever be in God, as it is not in itself.
- (2) The relation of the creation to God cannot be analogous to that of a product of human skill to its maker. The one is exterior to his work. The intelligence and the power of the other is eternally omnipresent to every element of his work.
- (3) A sense of absolute dependence for continued being, power, and blessedness, is involved in the religious consciousness of all men.
- (4)  It  is  explicitly  taught  in  Scripture:  "By  him  all  things  consist" (Col. 1:17). "He upholdeth all things by the word of his power" (Heb. 1:3). "In him we live and move and have our being." (Acts 17:28). "O bless  our  God...which  holdeth  our  soul  in  life"  (Ps.  66:8,9;  63:8; 36:6).
- 2. That God governs the actions of his creatures; and-
- 3.  That  his  government  extends  to  all  his  creatures  and  all  their actions, is proved-
- (1) By  the  fact  that  the  religious  nature  of  man  demands  the recognition  of  this  truth.  It  is  involved  in  the  sense  of  dependence and  of  subjection  to  a  moral  government  which  is  involved  in  all religious feeling, and is recognized in all religions.
- (2)  It  is  evidenced  in  the  indications  of  intelligence  everywhere present in the operations of external nature. The harmony, the due proportion, and the exquisite concurrence in action, which continue among  so  many  elements  throughout  ceaseless  changes,  prove beyond question  the  presence  of  an  intelligence  embracing  all  and directing each.
- (3) The same is likewise indicated in the intelligent design evidently pursued in the developments of human history during long periods and throughout vast areas, and embracing myriads of agents. "That God is in history" is a conclusion of just science as well as a dictate of true religion.
- (4) The Scriptures abound in prophecies fulfilled and unfulfilled, and promises and threatenings. Many of these are not mere enunciations of general  principles,  but  specific  declarations  of  purpose  with reference  to  his  treatment  of  individuals  conditioned  upon  their conduct.  The  fulfillment  of  these  could  not  be  left  to  the  ordinary course of nature, since there is often no natural connection between what is threatened or promised and the conditions on which they are suspended. God must therefore, by a constant providential regulation  of  the  system  of  things,  execute  his  own  word  to  his creatures.
- (5) The Scriptures explicitly declare that such a providential control is exerted-(a) Over the physical world (i.) In general (Job 37:6-13; Ps. 104:14;  135:6,7;  147:15-18).  (ii.)  Individual  events  in  the  natural

world, however trivial (Matt. 10:29). (b) Over fortuitous events (Job 5:6; Prov. 16:33). (c) Over the brute creation (Ps. 104:21-27; 147:9). (d)  Over  the  general  affairs  of  men  (Job  12:23;  Isa.  10:12-15;  Dan. 2:21; 4:25). (e) Over the circumstances of individuals (1 Sam. 2:6-8; Prov.  16:9;  James  4:13-15).  (f)  Over  the  free  actions  of  men  (Ex. 12:36; Ps. 33:14,15; Prov. 19:21; 21:1; Phil. 2:13). (g) Over the sinful actions of men (2 Sam. 16:10; Ps. 76:10; Acts 4:27,28). (h) Especially all that is good in man, in principle or action, is attributed to God's constant gracious control (Phil. 2:13; 4:13; 2 Cor. 12:9,10; Eph. 2:10; Ps. 119:36; Gal. 5:22,25).

- 4. That the providential control of all things by God is the consistent execution in time of his eternal and immutable purpose is evident-
- (1)  From  the  statement  of  the  case.  Since  God's  eternal  purpose relates  to  and  determines  all  that  comes  to  pass,  and  since  it  is immutable, his providential control of all things must be in execution of  his  purpose.  And  since  his  purpose  is  infinitely  wise,  righteous, and  benevolent,  and  absolutely  sovereign  (as  shown  above),  his providential execution of the decree must possess the same characteristics.
- (2)  The  same  is  explicitly  declared  in  Scripture:  "He  worketh  all things after the counsel of his own will." (Eph. 1:11; Isa. 28:29; Acts 15:18.)
- 5. It is evident that the chief design of God in his eternal purpose and in  his  works  of  creation  must  also  be  his  chief  end  in  all  his providential  dispensations.  This  has  been  shown  above  to  be  the manifestation of his own glory. It is also directly asserted as the final end of his providence. (Rom. 9:17; 11:36.)

SECTION  2:  ALTHOUGH  in  relation  to  the  foreknowledge  and decree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass immutably and infallibly;(8) yet, by the same providence, he orders them to fall out according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently.(9)

## SECTION 3: 
GOD in his ordinary providence makes use of means, (10) yet is free to work without,(11) above,(12) and against them,(13) at his pleasure.

- (8) Acts 2:23. (9) Gen. 8:22; Jer. 31:35; Ex. 21:13; Deut. 19:5; 1 Kings 22:28,34; Isa. 10:6,7. (10) Acts 27:31,44; Isa. 55:10,11; Hos. 2:21,22. (11) Hos. 1:7; Matt. 4:4; Job 34:10. (12) Rom. 4:19-21. (13) 2 Kings 6:6; Dan. 3:27.

These  sections  teach  the  doctrine  that  God's  purpose  is  efficacious and consistent, effected through means (secondary causes subject to His control), and that He possesses the power to effect His purpose directly and through His own energy.

### 1.
That  the  providential  control  which  God  exercises  over  all  his creatures and all their actions is always certainly efficacious, plainly follows (1) From his own infinite wisdom and power. (2) From the fact, before proved, that his eternal purpose determines the occurrence of all that comes to pass, and is immutable and certainly efficacious. (3) The fact is expressly declared in Scripture. (Job 23:13; Ps. 33:11; Lam. 2:17.)

### 2.
That  the  manner  in  which  God  controls  his  creatures  and  their actions,  and  effects  his  purposes  through  them,  is  in  every  case perfectly consistent with the nature of the creature and of his mode of action, is certain-
    - (1)  From the fact that God executes the different parts of the same eternal, self-consistent purpose, in his works of creation and providence. It is in the execution of the same unchangeable plan that God first created everything, endowed it with its properties, determined its mode of action and its mutual relations to all other things, and ever afterward continues to preserve it in the possession of its properties and to guide it in the exercise of them. As God must always be consistent to his own plan, so his mode of action upon the creatures whose existence and constitution have been determined by that plan must always be consistent with their natures and mode of action so determined.

    - (2) The  same  fact is proved by our uniform  experience  and observation. We are conscious of acting freely according to the law of our constitution as free agents. Even in the writings of the prophets and  apostles,  who  wrote  under  the  control  of  a  specific  divine influence, rendering even their selection of words infallibly accurate, we can plainly see that the spontaneous exercise of the faculties of the writers was neither superseded nor coerced. Every agent in the material  and  brute  creations,  also,  is  observed  constantly  to  act, under  all  changing  conditions,  according  to  the  uniform  law  of  its nature.
    
    - (3)  In  perfect  consistency  with  this,  we  see  everywhere  in  the material  world,  in  the  lives  of  individual  men,  and  in  all  human history, plain evidences of adjustments and combinations of elements and agents  in  the  order  of  contrivance  to  effect  purpose. This  in  principle  is  analogous  to,  though  in  many  ways  infinitely more  perfect  than,  the  methods  by  which  man  controls  natural agents to effect his purpose. If the laws of nature and the properties of  things,  when  imperfectly  understood,  can  be  brought  subject  to the  providence  of  man,  there  certainly  can  be  no  difficulty  in believing that they are infinitely more under the control of that God who not only understands them perfectly, but made them originally that  they  might  subserve  his  purpose.  It  is  just  the  perfection  of God's  adjustments  that  every  event,  as  well  as  general  results,  are determined by his intention. Even the human soul, in the exercise of free agency, acts according to a law of its own, excluding necessity, but not excluding certainty. The springs of free action are within the soul itself. And yet, as these are modified without interfering with the liberty  of  the  agent  by  the  influence  of  other  men,  they  certainly cannot lie beyond the control of the Infinite Intelligence who created

the soul itself, and has determined all the conditions under which its character has been formed and its activities exercised.

### 3.
That  God  ordinarily  effects  his  purposes  through  means-that  is, through  the  agency  of  second  causes  subject  to  his  control-is  also evident-
- (1)  From  the  fact  that  he  originally  gave  them  their  being  and properties, and adjusted their relations in the execution of these very purposes. The same design is pursued in creation and in providence. The instruments furnished and the methods of procedure inaugurated in creation must, therefore, be consistently pursued in the subsequent dispensations of providence.
- (2) Universal experience and observation teach us the same fact. In ordinary  providence  and  in  the  administration  of  a  supernatural economy of grace, in the sphere of material nature and in the moral government of intelligent and responsible agents, in the government of  the  finished  world  as  we  find  it  and  in  all  the  history  of  the formation of the Earth and the worlds in the past, God universally accomplishes  his  purposes  through  the  agency  of  second  causes, adjusted, combined, supported, and rendered efficient, by his omnipresent Spirit for this very end.
- (3) A system involving an established order of nature, and proceeding  in  wise  adaptation  of  means  to  ends,  is  necessary  as  a means  of  communication  between  the  Creator  and  the  intelligent creation, and to accomplish the intellectual and moral education of the latter. Thus only can the divine attributes of wisdom, righteousness,  or  goodness,  be  exercised  or  manifested;  and  thus only can angel or man understand the character, anticipate the will, or intelligently and cooperate with the plan of God.
### 4.
That God possesses the power of effecting his ends immediately, without the intervention of second causes, is self-evident; and that he at times at his sovereign pleasure exercises this power, is a matter of clear and satisfactory evidence.

- (1) Since God created all second causes and endowed them with their properties, and continues to uphold them in being, that they might be the instruments of his will, all their efficiency is derived from him, and he must be able to do directly without them what he does with them, and limit, modify, or supersede them, at his pleasure.
- (2) The power of God does indeed work in all the ordinary processes of nature, and his will is expressed in what is called natural law; but it does  not  follow  that  his  whole  power  is  exhausted  in  those processes, nor his whole will expressed in those laws. God remains infinitely  greater  than  his  works,  in  the  execution  of  his  eternal, immutable  purposes,  using  the  system  of  second  causes  as  his constant  instrument  after  its  kind,  and  meanwhile  manifesting  his transcendent  prerogatives  and  powers  by  the  free  exercises  of  his energies and utterances of his will.
- (3) Occasional direct exercises of God's power in connection with a general system of means and laws appear to be necessary, not only "in  the  beginning"  to  create  second  causes  and  inaugurate  their agency, but also subsequently in order to make to the subjects of his moral government the revelation of his free personality, and of his immediate interest in their affairs. At any rate such occasional direct action  and  revelation  are  certainly  necessary  for  the  education  of such beings as man is in his present estate. It has been objected that miracles, or direct acts of divine power, interfering with the natural action of second causes, are inconsistent with the infinite perfections of  God,  since  it  is  claimed  that  they  indicate  either  a  vacillation  of purpose upon his part, or some insufficiency in his creation to effect completely the ends he originally intended it to accomplish. It must be  remembered,  however,  that  the  eternal  and  immutable  plan  of God  comprehended  the  miracle  from  the  beginning  as  well  as  the ordinary  course  of  nature.  A  miracle,  although  effected  by  divine power without means, is itself a means to an end and part of a plan.

All natural law has its birth in the divine reason, and is an expression of will to effect a purpose. In this highest, all-comprehensive sense of the word, miracles also are according to law-they are fixed in their occurrence by God's eternal plan, and they serve definite ends as his means of communicating with and educating finite spirits. They are in  no  proper  sense  a  violation  of  the  order  of  nature,  but  only  the occasional and eternally pre-calculated interpolation of a new power, the immediate energy of the divine will. The order of nature is only an instrument of the divine will, and an instrument used subserviently  to  that  higher  moral  government  in  the  interests  of which miracles are wrought. Thus the order of nature and miracles, instead of being in conflict, are the intimately correlated elements of one comprehensive system.

## SECTION  4:
> THE  almighty  power,  unsearchable  wisdom,  and infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his providence, that it extends itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men,(14) and that not by a bare permission,(15) but such as has joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding, (16)  and  otherwise  ordering  and  governing  of  them,  in  a  manifold dispensation,  to  his  own  holy  ends;(17)  yet  so  as  the  sinfulness thereof  proceeds  only  from  the  creature,  and  not  from  God;  who, being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin.(18)
>
> (14) Rom. 11:32-34; 2 Sam. 24:1; 1 Chron. 21:1; 1 Kings 22:22,23; 1 Chron. 10:4,13,14; 2 Sam.16:10; Acts. 2:23; 4:27,28. (15) Acts 14:16. (16)  Ps.  76:10;  2  Kings  19:28.  (17)  Gen.  50:20;  Isa.  10:6,7,12.  (18) James 1:13,14,17; 1 John 2:16.

This  section  makes  no  attempt  to  explain  the  nature  of  those providential actions of God which are concerned in the origin of sin in the moral universe, and in the control of the willful actions of his creatures  in  the  execution  of  his  purposes.  It  simply  states  the important facts with respect to the relation of his providence to the sins  of  his  creatures  which  are  revealed  in  Scripture.  These  points are--

### 1. 
God not only permits sinful acts, but he directs and controls them to  the  determination  of  his  own  purposes.  Sinful  actions,  like  all others, are declared in Scripture to occur only by God's permission, and according to his purpose, so that what men wickedly do God is said to ordain (Gen. 14:4, 5; Ex. 7:13; 14:17; Acts 2:23; 3:18; 4:27,28). And he constantly restrains and controls men in their sins (Ps. 76:10; 2  Kings  19:28;  Isa.  10:15);  and  overrules  their  sins  for  good  (Acts 3:13; Gen. 50:20).

### 2
Yet the sinfulness of these actions is only from the sinning agent, and  God  in  no  case  is  either  the  author  or  approver  of  sin.  The providence  of  God,  instead  of causing  sin or approving  it, is constantly concerned in forbidding it by positive law, in discouraging it  by  threatenings  and  actual  punishments,  in  restraining  it  and  in overruling it against its own nature to good.

## SECTION 5:
> THE most wise, righteous, and gracious God, oftentimes leaves for a season his own  children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to make known them the hidden strength of corruption,  and  deceitfulness  of  their  hearts,  that  they  may  be humbled;(19)  and  to  raise  them  to  a  more  close  and  constant dependence for their support upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for various other just and holy ends. (20)

## SECTION 6:
> AS for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God, as a righteous judge, for former sins, blinds and hardens,(21) from them he  not  only  withholds  his  grace,  whereby  they  might  have  been enlightened  in  their  understandings  and  wrought  upon  in  their hearts;(22) but sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had, (23)  and  exposes  them  to  such  objects  as  their  corruption  makes occasion of sin;(24) and withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan:(25) whereby it comes to pass, that they harden themselves, even under those means which God uses for the softening of others.(26)

## SECTION 7:
> AS the providence of God does, in general, reach to all creatures;  so,  after  a  most  special  manner,  it  takes  care  of  his Church, and disposes all things to the good thereof.(27)

> (19)  2  Chron.  32:25,26,31;  2  Sam.  24:1.  (20)  2  Cor.  12:7-9;  Ps.  73; 77:1,10,12; Mark 14:66, to end; John 21:15-17. (21) Rom. 1:24,26,28; 11:7,8.  (22)  Deut.  29:4.  (23)  Matt.  13:12;  25:29.  (24)  Deut.  2:30;  2 Kings  8:12,13.  (25)  Ps.  81:11,12;  2  Thess.  2:10-12.  (26)  Ex.  7:3; 8:15,32;  2  Cor.  2:15,16;  Isa.  8:14;  1  Pet.  2:7,8;  Isa.  6:9,10;  Acts 28:26,27. (27) 1 Tim. 4:10; Amos 9:8,9; Rom. 8:28; Isa. 43:3-5,14.

We  have  seen  that  the  providential  government  of  God,  as  the execution through time of his eternal and immutable purpose, forms one  connected  system,  and  comprehends  all  created  things  and  all their actions. In perfect consistency with this, these sections proceed to teach:

### 1.
That  the  general providence of God, embracing and dealing with every  creature  according  to  its  nature,  consequently,  although  one system, embraces several subordinate systems intimately related as parts  of  one  whole,  yet  also  distinct  in  their  respective  methods  of administration and in the immediate ends designed. The principal of these  are,  the  providence  of  God  over  the  material  universe;  the general moral government of God over the intelligent universe; the moral government of God over the human family in general in this world;  and  the  special  gracious  dispensation  of  God's  providence toward his Church.

### 2.
These sections teach also that there is a relation of subordination subsisting between these several systems of providence, as means to ends  in  the  wider  system  which  comprehends  them  all.  Thus  the providential government of the material universe is subordinate as a means to an end to the moral government which God exercises over his intelligent creatures, for whose  residence, instruction, and development,  the  physical  universe  was  created.  Thus  also  the providential government of God over mankind in general is subordinate as a means to an end to his gracious providence toward his Church, whereby he gathers it out of every people and nation, and makes  all  things  work  together  for  good  to  those  who  are  called according to his purpose (Rom. 8:28), and of course for the highest development and glory of the whole body. The history of redemption through  all  its  dispensations,  Patriarchal,  Abrahamic,  Mosaic,  and Christian, is the key to the philosophy of human history in general. The  race  is  preserved,  continents  and  islands  are  settled  with inhabitants,  nations  are  elevated  to  empire,  philosophy  and  the practical arts, civilization and liberty are advanced, that the Church, the Lamb's bride, may be perfected in all her members and adorned for her Husband.

### 3.
The  moral  government  of  God  over  all  men,  and  especially  his government of his Church includes also, besides an external providence  ordering  the  outward  circumstances  of  individuals,  an internal spiritual providence, consisting of the influences of his Spirit upon  their  hearts.  As  "common  grace,"  this  spiritual  influence extends to all men without exception, though in serious degrees of power,  restraining  the  corruption  of  their  nature,  and  impressing their hearts and consciences with the truths revealed in the light of nature  or  of  revelation;  and  it  is  either  exercised  or  judicially withheld  by  God  at  his  sovereign  pleasure.  As  "efficacious"  and "saving grace," this spiritual influence extends only to the elect, and is exerted upon them at such times and in such degrees as God has determined from the beginning.

### 4.
Hence in the way of discipline for their own good, to mortify their sins and to strengthen their graces, God often wisely and graciously, though  never  finally,  for  a  season  and  to  a  degree,  withdraws  his spiritual influences from his own children, and "leaves them to the manifold temptations and corruptions of their own hearts."

### 5.
Hence also God often, as a just punishment of their sins, judicially withdraws  the  restraints  of  his  Spirit,  and  consequently  whatever superficial gifts his presence may have conferred, from ungodly men, and thus leaves them to the influence of temptations, the unrestrained  control  of  their  lusts,  and  the  power  of  Satan.  And hence  it  comes  to  pass  that  the  truths  of  the  gospel  and  the ordinances of the Church, which are a savor of life to them to whom they are graciously blessed, become a savor of death and of increased condemnation  to them  who  for their sins have been left to themselves.
