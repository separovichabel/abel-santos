# A Commentary on The Confession of Faith - A. A. Hodge

Archibald Alexander Hodge (1823–1886) was one of the most prominent figures of "Princeton Theology," succeeding his father, the legendary Charles Hodge, in the chair of Systematic Theology at Princeton Seminary. Known for his didactic precision and devotional warmth, A. A. Hodge possessed the rare gift of making complex theological concepts accessible without diluting their depth. This commentary on the Westminster Confession of Faith has served for generations as the standard guide for officers, seminarians, and laypeople who wish to understand not only what the Reformed faith confesses, but the biblical foundations of each doctrine.

The structure of this work was designed to offer a holistic understanding. Before entering the chapters of the Confession itself, the reader is provided with two essential introductions: one outlining a "Short History of the Creeds and Confessions," situating the Christian faith in time, and another detailing the "Origin of the Westminster Confession," providing the historical context of the Assembly that produced it. This ensures that dogmatic study is not conducted in a vacuum, but understood as part of the organic progression of Church history and the defense of orthodoxy.

Finally, this edition is enriched by appendices dealing with vital issues for Presbyterian identity and the application of the Confession. Texts on the "System of Doctrine" and "Adopting the Confession" address the nuances of confessional subscription and the historical debates between the Old School and New School. Also notable is the inclusion of Charles Hodge's classic essay, "What is Presbyterianism?", as well as pertinent discussions on the Auburn Declaration and the complex relationship between the Civil Magistrate and the Church.
