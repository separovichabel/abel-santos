# Chapter 8: Of Christ The Mediator

## SECTION I.
> IT pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain  the  Lord  Jesus,  his  only  begotten  Son,  to  be  the  Mediator between God and man;(1) the Prophet,(2) Priest,(3) and King;(4) the Head  and  Savior  of  his  Church;(5)  the  Heir  of  all  things;(6)  and Judge  of  the  world:(7)  unto  whom  he  did  from  all  eternity  give  a people to be his seed,(8) and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.(9)

Having already established the doctrine of God's sovereign election and the doctrine of the covenant of grace between the Father and His Son,  this  section  teaches  that  Christ  as  mediator  is  both  God  and man, exercising His authority as prophet, priest, and king. Moreover, He is Head and Savior of His Church, Heir of all things, and Judge of the  world.

### 1.  
**A  mediator  is  one  who  intervenes  between  contesting parties for the sake of making reconciliation.**

The term is sometimes applied to independent and disinterested parties called in to arbitrate a difficulty; sometimes to a dependent messenger or agent of one of the parties to the contest employed to carry overtures to the other party. In this sense Moses was a mediator between God and the people of Israel. (Deut. 5:5; Gal. 3:19.) Sometimes it is applied to an intercessor employed by the weaker party to influence the stronger.

The Scriptures apply the term, in a higher sense than any of these, to Christ.  They  teach  that  he  intervenes  between  God  and  man,  not merely  to  sue  for  peace  and  to  persuade  to  it,  but,  armed  with plenipotentiary power, efficiently to make peace and to do all that is necessary to that end.

The things necessary in order to this great end fall into two classes(1) Those that respect God, and (2) Those that respect men.

- (1) As  it respects  God,  it is absolutely  necessary,  in  order  to reconciliation, that the Mediator should propitiate the just

displeasure of God by expiating the guilt of sin, and that he should supplicate  in  our  behalf,  and  that  he  should  actually  introduce  our persons and services to the acceptance of the Father.

- (2)  As  it  respects  men,  it  is  absolutely  necessary  that  the  Mediator should reveal to them the truth concerning God and their relations to him,  and  the  conditions  of  acceptable  service; that he  should persuade and enable them to receive and obey the truth so revealed; and that he should so direct and sustain them, and so control all the outward influences to which they are subjected, that their deliverance from sin and from the powers of an evil world shall be perfected.

**The mediatorial office involves all the three great functions of prophet, priest, and king.**

Christ discharged them all, both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These are not three distinct offices meeting  accidentally in one office, but three functions inhering essentially in the one office of mediator. And they each so belong to the very essence of the office that the quality peculiar to each gives character to every mediatorial action. When he teaches, he is  always a priestly and kingly prophet. When he offers sacrifice or intercession for sin, he is always a prophetical and royal priest.

**(1) Christ is a Prophet.** A prophet is a spokesman; one sent from God to man to make known the divine will. In this sense Moses and all inspired men were prophets. But Christ was the personal "Word of God"  incarnate,  he  who  had  eternally  been  "in  the  bosom  of  the Father,"  and  "known  the  Father";  and  consequently  as  Mediatorial Prophet  is  that  original  fountain  of  revelation  of  which  all  other prophets  are  the  streams.  He  is  the  Prophet  of  all  prophets,  the Teacher of all teachers.

"He executes the office of a prophet, in his revealing to the Church, in all ages, by his Spirit and Word, in divers ways of administration, the whole  will  of  God,  in  all  things  concerning  their  edification  and salvation." (L. Cat., q. 43.) That this representation is true is proved from  the  fact  that  the  Scriptures-(a)  Explicitly  call  him  a  prophet. (Compare Deut. 18:15,18  and  Acts  3:22;  7:37;  Heb.  1:2.)  (b)  Teach that he  executed  the  functions  of  a  prophet  before  his  incarnation. (Isa. 9:6; Mal. 3:1; Job 33:23; 1 Pet. 1:11.) (c) Teach that he executes the office of a prophet since his incarnation. (Matt. 11:27; John 3:2; 6:68; Rev. 7:17; 21:3.)

**(2) Christ is a Priest.** A priest is **(a)** one taken from among men, **(b)** to appear in the presence of God and to treat in behalf of men; and **(c)**,  in  order  thereto,  to  make  propitiation  and  intercession.  It  is declared to be essential to the priest-**(a)** That he be a man chosen to represent men before God. Aaron always bore before the Lord for a memorial  a  breastplate  with  the  names  of  all  the  tribes  of  Israel engraved upon it. (Ex. 28:9,12,21,29.) (b) He must be chosen of God, as  his  special  election  and  property.  (Num.  16:5;  Heb.  5:4.)  (c)  He must be holy and consecrated to the Lord. (Lev. 21:6-8; Ex. 39:30,31; Ps. 106:16.) (d) He must have a right both to draw near to Jehovah and to bring near-i.e., to offer sacrifices and intercessions. (Lev. 16:315.)  (e)  He  must  have  an  acceptable  sacrifice  to  offer.  (Heb.  8:3.) Christ is in this sense a true priest, and he executes this office "in his once  offering  himself  a  sacrifice  without  spot  to  God,  to  be  a reconciliation  for  the  sins  of  his  people;  and  in  making  continual intercession  for  them."  (L.  Cat.,  q.  44.)  That  this  is  true  is  proved from the fact that the Scriptures declare-(a) That Christ possessed all the characteristic marks and qualifications of a priest. He became a man for this purpose. (Heb. 2: I6; 4:15.) He was chosen of God, as was  Aaron.  (Heb.  5:5,6.)  He  was  perfectly  holy,  and  had  right  of immediate approach to the Father. Heb. 8:6. (b) He is declared to be a  priest  in  the  Old  Testament.  The  entire  order  of  priests  and  the ceremonial of sacrifice were typical of him. {Zech. 6:13; Isa. 53:10; Dan.  9:24,25.)  (c)  The  Gospel  history  declares  that  he  actually discharged all the functions of a priest. He has made propitiation by a sacrificial bearing of the penalty due to sin. (Eph. 5:2; Heb. 9:26; 1 John 2:2.) He has made intercession, and he ever lives to intercede. (Rom.  8:34;  Heb.  7:25.)  The  work  of  Christ  was  the  substance  of which  the  entire  ceremonial  of  the  temple  was  the  shadow.  (Col. 2:17.)

His  priesthood  is  said  not  to  have  been  of  the  order  of  Aaron, because, although Aaron and his priesthood were types of Christ. and existed  simply  for  the  purpose  of  showing  forth  his  work,  yet  they were  inadequate  to  represent  him  fully  and  in  all  relations.  They were inadequate chiefly-(a) With respect to the incomparable dignity and excellence of his person. (John 1:1-4,14.) (b) The infinite value of his  sacrifice.  (Heb.  10:1-14.)  (c)  The  manner  of  their  consecration. (Heb. 7:20-22.) (d) They were constantly succeeding each other, as dying  men.  (Heb.  7:23,24.)  (e)  He  was  a  minister  of  a  greater  and more perfect tabernacle. (Heb. 9:11,24.) (f) They were mere priestshe was a royal and prophetical priest. (Zech. 6:13; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 8:1,2.)

His  priesthood  is  said  to  have  been  of  the  order  of  Melchizedek, because-(a) Like him he was a royal priest. (b) Like him, he had no predecessors or successors in office. He was the only one of his line. (c) Because he was an eternal priest: "Thou art a priest forever, of the order of Melchizedek." (Heb. 7:17.)

**(3) Christ is sovereign Head over all things to his Church.** (Eph. 1:22; 4:15; Col. 1:18; 2:19.) He executes the office of a king-**(a)** In calling out of the world a people to himself, and giving them offices, laws, and discipline, by which he visibly governs them; (b) In bestowing saving grace upon his elect, rewarding their obedience and correcting them for  their  sins,  and  preserving  and  supporting  them  under  all their temptations and sufferings; (c) In restraining and overcoming all their enemies, and powerfully ordering all things for his own glory and  their  good;  and  also  (d)  In  taking  vengeance  on  the  rest,  who know not God and obey not the gospel.

This  lordship  differs  from  that  which  belongs  essentially  to  the Godhead-(a) Because it is given to him by the Father as the reward of his obedience and suffering. Phil. 2:6-11. (b) The object and design of this mediatorial kingship has special reference to the upbuilding and glory  of  the  redeemed  Church.  (Eph.  1:22,23.)  (c)  The  dignity  and authority belong not to his deity abstractly, but to his entire person as God-man. This power and lordship Christ already possesses, and it extends over all creatures in all worlds. (Matt. 28:18; Eph. 1:17-23; Phil.  2:9-11;  Jer.  23:5;  Isa.  9:6;  Ps.  2:6;  Acts  2:29-36.)  And  of  this kingdom there shall be no end. (Dan. 2:44; Isa. 9:7.)

Thus Christ has been shown, as Mediator, to be-

### 3.
**Christ is Head  and  Savior  of  his  Church,  and  Heir  of  all  things.**

That  is, sovereign  ruler  and  disposer  of  all  things  throughout  all  worlds. (Eph.  1:10.)  That  element  of  Christ's  dominion  which  shall  be exercised in his judging men and angels at the end will be considered under chapter 33.

## SECTION II.
> THE Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did,  when  the  fullness  of  time  was  come,  take  upon  him  man's nature,(10) with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin;(11) being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary of her substance.(12) So that two  whole,  perfect,  and  distinct  natures,  the  Godhead  and  the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion.(13) Which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man.(14)

> (10) John 1:1,14; 1 John 5:20; Phil. 2:6; Gal. 4:4. (11) Heb. 2:14,16,17; 4:15.  (12)  Luke  1:27,31,35;  Gal.  4:4.  (13)  Luke  1:35;  Col.  2:9;  Rom. 9:5; 1 Pet. 3:18; 1 Tim. 3:16. (14) Rom. 1:3,4; 1 Tim. 2:5.

The  subject  of  this  section  is  the  constitution  of  the  person  of  the Mediator  as  the  God-man.  Having  proven  (ch.  2.,  s.  3)  that  Jesus Christ  is  the  one  God;  the  second  person  of  the  Trinity,  of  one substance and equal with the Father, this section further dwells on the perssonality and natures of Christ.

The most ancient and universally accepted statement of the Church doctrine as to the person of Christ is that which was formed by the fourth  General  Council,  consisting  of  "six  hundred  and  thirty  holy and  blessed  fathers,"  who  were  convened  in  Chalcedon  A.D.  451:

> "We,  then,  following  the  holy  Fathers,  all  with  one  consent,  teach men to confess  one  and  the  same  Son,  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ;  the same perfect  in  Godhead,  and  also  perfect  in  manhood;  truly  God and truly  man,  of  a  reasonable  soul  and  body;  consubstantial  with the  Father  according  to  the  Godhead,  and  consubstantial  with  us according  to  the  manhood;  in  all  things  like  unto  us  without  sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, according to the manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only Begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably, the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property  of  each  nature  being  preserved  and  concurring  in  one Person and one Substance, not parted or divided into two persons, but  one  and  the  same  Son  and  Only  begotten,  God  the  Word,  the Lord Jesus Christ, as the prophets have from the beginning declared concerning  him,  and  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  himself  has  taught  us, and the creed of the holy Fathers has delivered to us."

### 1.
**Jesus  of  Nazareth  was  a  true  man,  possessing  all  the  essential properties of humanity, conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost in the  womb  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  of  her  substance.**

This  includes  two constituent propositions-**(1)** Jesus Christ was a true and proper man, possessing all the essential properties of humanity. He is constantly and characteristically  called  the  Man  Christ  Jesus,  and  the  Son  of Man. (Matt. 8:20; 1 Tim. 2:5.) He had a true body, for he ate, drank, slept,  and increased in stature. (Luke 2:52.) Through his whole life he was in all public and private association recognized as a true man. He died in agony on the cross, was buried, rose again, and proved his

identity  by  physical  signs.  (Luke  24:36-44.)  He  had  a  reasonable soul,  for  he  increased  in  wisdom,  loved,  sympathized,  wept  and shrank from suffering as a man. (John 11:33-35; Matt. 26:36-46.) **(2)** The human nature of Jesus is not an independent creation merely. Like ours, but it was generated out of the common life of our race, of the  very  substance  of  the  Virgin  Mary,  by  the  power  of  the  Holy Ghost. The angels do not constitute a race produced by generation, but  only  a  collection  of  individuals.  This  distinction  is  emphasized when  it  is  declared  of  Christ,  "He  took  not  on  him  the  nature  of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham." (Heb. 2:16.) He is the seed of Eve (Gen. 3:15); the seed of David ( Rom. 1:3.) He was made of a woman (Gal. 4:4); conceived by her in her womb (Luke 1:31; 2:5-7).

### 2.
**Jesus, although tempted in all points like as we are, was yet absolutely without sin.**This is expressly declared in Scripture. (Heb. 4:15.) Peter testifies of him that "he did no sin, neither was guile found in his  mouth."  (1  Pet.  2:22.)  John  testifies  that  "in  him  is  no  sin."  (1 John 3:5; Heb. 7:26; Luke 1:35.) The same is evident from the origin and  constitution  of  his  person  as  the  Incarnate  Word;  from  the nature of the work he came to perform as the deliverer of men from sin; and from the record of his holy life preserved by the evangelists, which  remains,  in  the  constrained  acknowledgments  of  infidels  as well as the faith of Christians, the great moral miracle of all ages.

### 3.
**He was no less very God, the eternal Son of the Father.**

This has been already proven. Ch. 2., s. 3.

### 4.
**Nevertheless, this God and this man is one single person.**

This is proven in every way that such a truth can be verified. **(1)** In all the record  of  his  life there  is no  word  spoken  of  him,  no  action performed by him, no attribute predicated of him, that suggests the idea  that  he  is  not  one  single,  indivisible  person.  **(2)**  The  personal pronouns are always used by him and applied to him as if he were a single person. Of the same subject and in the same connection divine attributes and actions and human  attributes and actions are

predicated. **(3)** To make the matter more certain and evident, there are passages in which the person is designated by a title proper to his divine  nature,  while  the  attribute  or  action  predicated  of  him  is proper to his human nature; e.g., "The Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (Acts 20:28); "Crucified the Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8.) **(4)** There are other passages in which the person is designated  by  a  title  proper  to  the  human  nature,  while  the attribute  or  action  predicated  of  it  is  proper  to  the  divine  nature: "The Son of man, who is in heave," (John 3:13); "If Ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before" (John 6:62). **(5)** There are other passages in which divine and human attributes and actions are indiscriminately predicated of the same person: "Who hath . . . translated  us  into  the  kingdom  of  his  dear  Son:  in  whom  we  have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature . . . and having made peace through the blood of his cross," etc. (Col. 1:13-20; Heb. 1:3.)

### 5.
**This personality is that of the eternal Son of God, who in time took a  human  soul  and  body  into  personal  union  with  himself.**  This remarkable  person  did  not  begin  to  exist,  and  therefore  was  not constituted,  when  he  was  conceived  in  the  womb  of  the  Virgin. "Before Abraham was, I am," he says. (John 8:58.) "The Word was made flesh."  (John  1:14.)  "God  sent  his  only  begotten  Son  into  the world." (1 John 4:9.) The Son was "made of a woman, made under the law." (Gal. 4:4.) "Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and  blood,  he  also  himself  likewise  took  part  of  the  same."  (Heb. 2:14;  Phil.  2:6-11.)  Hence  it  is  evident  that  the  person  of  Christ  is divine, and not human-eternal, and not formed in time. But in time this eternal divine person took a human nature (soul and body) into its  personality.  Just  as  the  body,  with  its  wonderful  constitution  of organs, nerves, senses, and passions, has no personality of its own, but, during its entire life in the womb, grows into the personality of the soul; so the human nature of Christ never for an instant had a separate  personal  existence  of  its  own,  but,  from  the  instant  of  its conception,  grew  into  the  eternal  personality  of  the  Son  of  God.

There are in Christ, therefore, two natures, but one person; a human as  well  as  a  divine  nature,  but  only  a  divine  person.  His  humanity began to exist in the womb of the Virgin, but his person existed from eternity. His divinity is personal, his humanity impersonal, and his divine nature and his human nature one person.

### 6.
**Although but one person, the divine and human natures in Christ are not mixed or confused in one, but remain two pure and distinct natures, divine and human, constituting one person forever.**

It is impossible  for  us  to  explain  philosophically  how  two  selfconscious  intelligences,  how  two  self-determined  free  agents,  can constitute  one  person;  yet  this  is  the  precise  character  of  the phenomenon revealed in the history of Jesus. In order to simplify the matter,  some  errorists  have  supposed  that  in  the  person  of  Christ there was no human soul, but that his divine spirit took the place of the human soul in his human body. Others have so far separated the two natures as to make him two persons-a God and a man intimately united. Others have so pressed the natures together that neither pure divinity nor pure humanity is left, but a new nature resulting from the  mixing  of  both.  That  Christ's  two  natures  remain  separate  and unconfused, is self-evident. The very point proved in Scripture is that Christ always continued a true God and true man-not something else between  the  two.  The  essential  properties  of  divinity  cannot  be communicated to humanity-that is, humanity cannot be made to be infinite, self- eternal, and absolutely perfect; because, if it possessed these,  it  would  cease  to  be  human;  and  because  even  God  himself cannot create divinity, and therefore cannot make humanity divine. The same is true with respect to Christ's divinity. If that should take on the limitations of humanity, it would cease to be divine, and even God is not able to destroy divinity. Hence, since Christ is both God and  man,  it  follows  that  he  cannot  be  a  mixture  of  both,  which  is neither.  Hence,  while  the  Scriptures  constantly  affirm  (as  we  have seen)  of  the  one  person  whatsoever  is  true,  without  exception,  of either nature, they never affirm of either nature that which belongs to the other. It is said that God-i.e., the person who is a God-gave his blood for his Church; but it is never said that his divinity died, or that his humanity came down from heaven.

## SECTION III.
> THE Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine,  was  sanctified  and  anointed  with  the  Holy  Spirit  above measure;(15) having in him  all the treasures of wisdom  and knowledge;(16) in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell;(17) to the end, that being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth,(18) he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the office  of  a  Mediator  and  Surety.(19)  Which  office  he  took  not  unto himself,  but  was  thereunto  called  by  his  Father;(20)  who  put  all power and judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to execute the same.(21)

These sections teach:

### 1.
**The  effect  of  this  hypostatical  union  upon  the  human  nature  of Christ.**

The effect was not to deify it, since, as we saw above, the human nature as well as the divine nature remains pure, separate, and unchanged, after  as  before.  But  the  effect  of  this  union  was-**(1)**  To  exalt  the human  nature  of  Christ  to  a  degree  of  dignity  and  honor  greatly beyond  that  attained  by  any  other  creature.  **(2)**  To  fill  it  with  a perfection  of  intellectual  and  moral  excellence  beyond  that  of  any other creature. The Father gave not the Spirit by measure unto him. (John  3:34.)  "It  pleased  the  Father  that  in  him  should  all  fullness dwell." (Col. 1: l9.) His person, therefore, possessed all the properties belonging to absolute divinity, and an all-perfect and incomparably exalted manhood, and was thoroughly furnished to execute the office of Mediator and Surety.

### 2.
**Christ  was  Mediator,  and  discharged  all  the  functions  of that office, not as God, nor as man, but as God-man.**

As this point is more directly called up by the seventh section of this chapter, it will be considered in that place.

### 3.
**Christ was appointed to this office by the Father, and acts in it upon an authority derived from the Father.**

This is very prominently as well as clearly set forth in Scripture: "And no man takes this honour unto  himself,  but  he  that  is  called  of  God,  as  was  Aaron.  So  also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but . . . he was called of  God  an  high  priest  after  the  order  of  Melchizedek."  (Heb. 5:4-10.) Christ constantly affirms that he was "sent by the Father"; that the Father had given him "a commandment"; that the "works" which he performed and the "words" which he spoke were not his, but the Father's that sent him. "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own

will,  but  the  will  of  the  Father  which  hath  sent  me."  (John  5:30.) "Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me." (John 7:16.) "If  ye  loved  me,  ye  would  rejoice,  because  I said,  I  go  unto  the  Father;  for  my  Father  is  greater  than  I."  (John 14:24,28,31; 10:18; 12:49; 4:34.)

The Eternal Word is of the same identical substance with and equal to  the  Father  in  power  and  glory.  But  the  God-man,  in  his  official relations  and  works,  is  officially,  and  as  far  as  concerns  these relations and  actions  alone,  inferior to the Father-sent  by  his authority, acting for him, returning and accounting to him.

### 4.
**Christ took this office and all it involved upon himself  voluntarily.**

This is very  evident-**(1)**  Because  otherwise,  being absolute  God,  it  could  never  have  been  imposed  upon  him.  **(2)** Because  otherwise  his  obedience  and  suffering  could  not  have vicariously availed for us. **(3)** Because otherwise the execution of the law upon him would have been outrageously unjust. **(4)** Because it is expressly  declared.  Speaking  of  his  life,  he  said,  "No  man  takes  it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and I  have  power  to  take  it  again."  (John  10:18.)  The  motive  which impelled him to the self-sacrificing undertaking was a personal love for his people "which passes knowledge." (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 3:19; 5:2.)

### 5.
**Christ  discharged  the  functions  of  the  mediatorial  office  in  his estate of humiliation.**

**(1) In his being born, and that in a low condition.** It is evident that nothing could be added to the divine perfections by the assumption of a human nature into a personal relation. On the other hand it is an act  of  infinite  condescension  on  the  part  of  the  Godhead  of  Jesus, and of transcendent and permanent benefit to the whole intelligent creation, that all the fullness of the Godhead should be contained in him bodily, and so revealed under the limitations of a finite nature. For it is only thus that the Infinite can be "seen and known," "tasted

and  handled,"  and  that  of  "his  fullness"  we  may  all  receive,  and "grace for grace" (John 1:16,18; 1 John 1:1.)

**(2) In his being made under the law, and rendering perfect obedience to it.** The law lays its claims not upon natures, but upon persons. The person of Christ was eternal and divine. Personally, therefore, he was the  norm,  the  Author  and  Lord  of  the  law,  his  divine  perfections being the necessary and supreme Law to himself and to the universe he had made. Therefore he owed nothing to the law, since the law was conformed to him, not he to the law.

But,  as  we  have  seen,  chap.  7.,  s.  3,  in  the  covenant  of  grace  the Mediator assumes in behalf of his elect seed the broken conditions of the  old  covenant  of  works  precisely  as  Adam  left  them.  In  that covenant  punishment  was  conditioned  upon  disobedience,  and  life and blessedness upon obedience. Therefore it was necessary that the "second Adam" should render vicarious obedience in order to secure for his people the promised reward, as well as that he should suffer the  penalty  in  order  to  secure  for  them  the  remission  of  sins.  By Christ's  suffering  (passive  obedience),  our  Confession  teaches,  he purchases for us reconciliation; while by his fulfilling the precepts of the  law  (active  obedience)  he  purchases  for  us  "an  everlasting inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven."  Chap.  8.,  s.  5.  Christ, therefore, was "made under the law" (Gal. 4:4,5), (a) Not as a rule of righteousness,  but  as  a  condition  of  blessedness,  "to  redeem  them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." (b) Not for himself, but officially as our representative. (c) His whole obedience of that law was vicarious-instead of our obedience and for our sakes. "By the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (Rom. 5:19.)

**(3) His undergoing the miseries of this life, the wrath of God, and the cursed death of the cross.** Christ was the representative of his people, and all his obedience and suffering was vicarious, from his birth until all the conditions of the covenant of life were fulfilled. All his earthly career was in one aspect suffering, in another aspect obedience. As

suffering,  it  was  a  vicarious  endurance  of  the  penalty  of  sin.  As obedience, it was the discharge in the stead and behalf of his people of that condition upon which their eternal inheritance is suspended. The  two  were  never  separated  in  fact.  They  are  only  the  two  legal aspects  presented  by  the  same  life  of  suffering  obedience.  The essence of the penalty vicariously borne by Christ was "the wrath of God."  The  incidents  of  it  were  "the  miseries  of  this  life."  The culmination  of  it  was  "the  cursed  death  of  the  cross,"  (Gen.  2:17; Heb. 9:22.)

**(4) In his being buried, and continuing under the power of death for a  time.**

In  the  Creed  commonly  called  the  Apostles'  Creed,  and adopted  by  all  the  Churches,  this  last  stage  of  the  humiliation  of Christ is expressed by the phrase, "He descended into hell" (Hades, the  invisible  world).  This  means  precisely  what  our  Confession affirms, that while  the  body  of  Jesus  remained  buried  in  the sepulcher  his  soul  remained  temporarily  divorced  from  it  in  the unseen world of spirits.

Some (as Pearson on the Creed, pp. 333-371) have held that as Christ died vicariously as a sinner, so, in order to fulfill the law of death, his soul went temporarily to the place where the souls of those who die for their own sins die the second death forever.

The Lutherans teach that  the  descent  of  the  God-man  into  hell,  in order to triumph over Satan and his angels in the very citadel of his kingdom, was the first step in his exaltation. (Form. Of Concord, part 2., chap. 9.)

The  Romanists  teach  that  Christ  went,  while  his  body  was  in  the grave, to that department of Hades (invisible world) which they call the Limbus Patrum , where the believers under the old dispensation were gathered, to preach the gospel to them, and to take them with him to the heaven he had prepared for them. (Cat. of the Coun. of Trent, part 1., art. 5.)

### 6.
**He  executed  the  functions  of  his  mediatorial  office  also  in  his estate of exaltation.**

**(1) In  his  rising  from  the  dead  on  the  third  day.**

The  fact  of  his resurrection is proved. **(a)** Predicted in the Old Testament. (Compare Ps. 16:10;  Acts  2:24-31.)  **(b)**  Christ  himself  predicted  it.  Matt. 20:18,19; John 10:17,8. **(c)** The witness of the eleven apostles. (Acts 1:3.) **(d)** The separate testimony of Paul. (1 Cor. 15:8; Gal. 1:12; Acts 9:3-8.)  **(e)**  He  was  seen  by  five  hundred  brethren  at  once.  (1  Cor. 15:6.) **(f)** The miracles wrought by the apostles in attestation of the fact. (Heb. 2:4.) **(g)** The witness of the Holy Ghost. (Acts 5:32.) **(h)** The change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week.

The  importance  of  the  fact  is  proved  to  be  fundamental.  **(a)**  The resurrection  of  Christ  is  the  pledge  for  the  fulfillment  of  all  the prophecies and promises of both Testaments. **(b)** It proved him to be the Son of God, because it authenticated his claims, and because he rose  by  his  own  power.  (John  2:19;  10:17.)  **(c)**  It  was  a  public acceptance  of  his  mediatorial  work  in  our  behalf  by  the  Father. (Rom. 4:25.) **(d)** Hence we have an advocate with the Father. (1 John 2:1; Rom. 8:34.) **(e)** "If Christ lives, we shall live also." (John 14:19; 1 Pet. 1:3-5; 1 Cor. 15:21,22.) **(f)** His resurrection secures ours. (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 6:15; 15:49; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2.)

**(2) In his ascending up into heaven.** This took place forty clays after his  resurrection,  from  a  portion  of  the  Mount  of  Olives  near  to Bethany,  in  the  presence  of  the  eleven  apostles  and  possibly  other disciples.  He  ascended  as  Mediator,  triumphing  over  his  enemies and  giving  gifts to his friends (Eph.  4:8-12), to complete  his mediatorial work, as the forerunner of his people (John 14:2, 3; Heb. 6:20), and to fill the universe with the manifestations of his power and glory. (Eph. 4:10.)
**(3)  In  his  sitting  at  the  right  hand  of  God  the  Father,  where  he intercedes for, and reigns over all things in the behalf of, his people.**

The passages which speak of this session of the Mediator at the right hand of  the  Father  are,  Ps.  16:1l;  110:1;  Dan.  7:13,14;  Matt.  26:64; Mark 16:19; John 5:22; Rom. 8:34; Eph. 1:20,22; Phil. 2:9-11; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3,4; 2:9; 10:12; 1 Pet. 3:22; Rev. 5:6. This right hand of God denotes the official exaltation of the Mediator to supreme glory, felicity, and  dominion  over  every  name  that  is named.  It is, moreover, a definite  place,  since  the  finite  soul  and  body  of  Christ must be in a definite place, and there his glory is revealed and his authority exercised. There he intercedes for his people, a priest upon his  throne  (Zech.  6:13);  and  hence  he  effectually  applies  to  his people, by his Spirit, that salvation which he had previously achieved for them in his estate of humiliation.

With the presentation of "his  own  blood"  (Heb.  9:12,24)  he  pleads for those who are embraced in his covenant, and for those blessings in  their  behalf  which  in  that  covenant  were  conditioned  upon  his obedience and suffering. (John 17:9; Luke 22:32; see John 17.) His intercession  is  always  prevalent  and  successful.  (John  11:42;  Ps. 21:2.)

**(4)  In  his  coming  to  judge  the  world  at  the  last  day.**

This  will  be discussed in its proper place, under chapter 33.

## SECTION V.
> THE Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, has fully satisfied the justice of his Father,(34) and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given to him.

> ALTHOUGH the work of redemption was not actually wrought by Christ until after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and  benefits  thereof,  were  communicated  to  the  elect  in  all  ages successively  from  the  beginning  of  the  world,  in  and  by  those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed and signified  to  be  the  Seed  of  the  woman,  which  should  bruise  the serpent's head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, being yesterday and today the same, and forever.(36)

Compare chapter 11., s. 3: "Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully  discharge  the  debt  of  all  those  that  are  thus  justified,  and  did make  a  proper,  real,  and  full  satisfaction  to  his  Father's  justice  in their behalf."

These sections teach:

### 1.
**Christ made satisfaction for those whom he represented, both by  his  obedience  and  by  his  sacrifice  of  himself.**

This  has  been  shown above  (chap.  7.,  s.  3,  and  8.,  s.  4).  This  truth  is  taught  in  the Confessions  of  all the Churches,  Lutheran  and  Reformed.  The Heidelberg Catechism, one of the most generally adopted of all the Reformed Confessions, says, question 60: "God, without any merit of mine but only of mere grace, grants and imputes to me the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, . . . as if I had fully accomplished all that obedience which Christ hath accomplished for me."

The Formula of Concord, a Lutheran Confession, says: "Since Christ was not only man, but God and man in one undivided person, so he was  not  subject  to  the  law,  nor  obnoxious  to  suffering  and  death, because he was the Lord of the law. On which account his obedience is  imputed  to  us;  so  that  God  on  account  of  that  whole  obedience (which Christ by his acting and by his suffering, in his life and in his death, for our sake rendered to his Father who is in heaven) remits our sins, reputes us as good and just, and gives us eternal salvation."

### 2.
**Christ  thus  has,  in  strict  rigor,  fully  satisfied  all  the  demands  of divine justice upon those whom he represents.**

Jesus Christ has met the  divine  demand  that  the  original  covenant  of  works  be  fulfilled through the sorrow of His life and death, and he has met the divine demand for  essential  justice  in  the  punishment  of  sin  through  the obedience  unto  death.  Christ  suffered  as  the  representative  of sinners. Our sins were laid upon him. He, "hath redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us." He died, "the just for the unjust." "He is the propitiation (expiation) for our sins." He "gave his life a ransom for many." We are "bought with a price." (Gal. 3:13;  1  Pet.  3:18;  1  John  2:2;  Matt.  20:28;  1  Cor.  6:20.)  Christ suffered only in his single human soul and body, and only for a time. Nevertheless, his person was the infinite and transcendently glorious person of the eternal Son of God. Consequently his sufferings were precisely,  both  in  kind  and  in  degree,  what  the  infinitely  righteous wisdom of God saw to be in strict rigor a full equivalent, in respect to the  demands  of  legal  justice,  for  the  eternal  sufferings  of  all  for whom  he  suffered.  This  is  the  doctrine  of  the  whole  Christian Church. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, say, Art. 31:  "The  offering  of  Christ,  once  made,  is  that  perfect  redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual."

The Catechism of the Council of Trent, 2.5, 63: "Whatever is due by us to God on account of our sins has been paid abundantly, although he should deal with us according to the strictest rigor of his justice. . . . For it we are indebted to Christ alone, who, having paid the price of our sins on the cross, most fully satisfied God."

### 3.
**Christ has,  according  to  the  terms  of  the  everlasting covenant, not only secured in behalf of those whom he represented remission  of  sins  and  propitiation  of  divine  wrath,  but  also  an everlasting  inheritance  in  the  kingdom  of  glory.**

The  sufferings  of Christ secure  the remission  of  the penalty; and  by  his active obedience, according to the terms of the covenant made with Adam and  assumed  by  Christ,  he  purchases  a  right  to  life  and  eternal blessedness.  That  he  has  so  purchased  eternal  life  for  all  those  in whose stead he rendered obedience, is proved from the fact that the

Scriptures habitually set forth the truth that the "adoption of sons" and "eternal life" are given to the believer freely for Christ's sake, as elements of that purchased possession of which the Holy Spirit is the earnest.  (Eph.  1:11-14;  Rom.  8:15-17;  Gal.  1:4;  3:13,14;  4:4,5;  Eph. 5:25-27; Titus 3:5,6; Rev. 1:5,6; 5:9,10.)

This proves, therefore-(1) That Christ did not die simply to make the salvation  of  those  for  whom  he  died  possible-i.e.,  to  remove  legal obstructions to their salvation-but that he died with the design and effect  of  actually  securing  their  salvation  and  of  endowing  them gratuitously with an inalienable title to heaven. (2) It proves, in the second place, that the vicarious sufferings of Christ must have been, in design  and  effect, personal  and  definite  as  to their object. Salvation  must  be  applied  to  all  those  for  whom  it  was  purchased. Since not the possibility or opportunity for reconciliation, but actual reconciliation itself was purchased; since not only reconciliation, but a title to an eternal inheritance was purchased, it follows (a) That "to all those  for  whom  Christ  hath  purchased  redemption,  he  doth certainly  and  effectually  apply  and  communicate  the  same."  (Conf. Faith, ch. 8. s. 8.) And  (b)  That  he  who  never  receives  the inheritance,  and  to  whom  the  purchased  grace  is  never  applied,  is not one of the persons for whom it was purchased.

### 4.
**Although this satisfaction was rendered by Christ only after his incarnation yet the full benefits thereof had been applied to each of the elect severally in their successive  generations  from  the beginning, by the Holy Ghost, through the various forms of truth to them made known.**

This has been proved at length and illustrated (chap. 7. ss. 5, 6).

## SECTION VII.
>  CHRIST,  in  the  work  of  mediation,  acts  according  to both natures; by each nature doing that which is proper to itself;(37) yet by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by the other nature.(38)

> (37) Heb. 9:14; 1 Pet. 3:18. (38) Acts 20:28; John 3:13; 1 John 3:16.

Under section 2. we saw-**(1)** That Jesus of Nazareth was a true man. **(2)**  That  he  was  true  God.  **(3)**  That  he  was  nevertheless  one  single person.  **(4)**  That  his  personality  is  eternal  and  divine,  his  human nature  having  been  generated  into  the  pre-existent  person  of  the Son. **(5)** That these two natures remain one person, yet distinct and unchanged  divinity  and  humanity,  without  mixture  or  confusion. This section proceeds to state:

### 1.
**All Christ's mediatorial actions involve the concurrent activities  of  both  natures,  each  nature  contributing  that  which  is proper to itself.**

Thus  the  divine  nature  of  Christ  is  that  fountain  from  which  his revelation as prophet is derived. Other prophets reflect his light, or transmit what they receive from him. He is the original source of all divine knowledge. At the same time his humanity is the form through which his Godhead is revealed, his flesh the veil through which its glory is transmitted. His person as incarnate God is the focus of all revelations-the subject as well as the organ  of all prophetical teaching.

Thus, also, the human nature of Christ was necessary in order that his person should be "made under the law"; and it is the subject of his vicarious sufferings, and the organ of his vicarious obedience and intercession as our representative Priest and Intercessor. At the same time,  it  is  only  the  supreme  dignity  of  his  divine  person  which renders  his  obedience  supererogatory  and  therefore  vicarious,  and the temporary and finite sufferings of his humanity a full equivalent in justice-satisfying efficacy for the eternal sufferings of all the elect. Thus, also, the activities of his divinity and humanity are constantly and  beautifully  blended  in  all  his  administrative  acts  as  King.  The last  Adam,  the  second  Man,  the  Head  of  a  redeemed  and  glorified race, the First-born among many brethren, he has dominion over all creatures; and with a human heart acting out through the energies of divine wisdom and power, he makes all things work together for the accomplishment of his purposes of love.

All mediatorial acts are therefore to be attributed to the entire person of  the  Theanthropos-God-man.  And  in  the  whole  or  his  glorious person is he to be obeyed and worshipped by angels and men.

### 2.
**Because of the unity of both natures in one person, that which is proper  to  either  nature  belongs  of  course  to  that  one  person.**

Sometimes  in  Scripture  that  which  is  proper  to  one  nature  is attributed to the person denominated by the other nature. Thus, as shown above under section 2., the Scriptures often say that God shed his  blood  for  his  Church,  or  that  the  Son  of  man  came  down  from heaven, while they never say that the human nature of Christ came down from heaven, or that his divine nature suffered for his Church.

## SECTION VIII.
> TO all those for whom Christ has purchased redemption, he certainly and effectually applies and communicates the  same;(39)  making  intercession  for  them;(40)  and  revealing  to them, in and by the Word, the mysteries of salvation;(41) effectually persuading  them  by  his  Spirit  to  believe  and  obey;  and  governing their hearts by his Word and Spirit;(42) overcoming all their enemies by his almighty power and wisdom, in such manner and ways as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation.(43)

This section teaches:

### 1.
**Christ, as mediatorial King, seated at the right hand of God, applies  the  redemption  he  had  effected  as  Priest  to  the  proper subjects of it.**

This point has been already discussed under chap. 7., s. 4,  and  chap.  8.  ss.  1,  4,  when  we  were  treating  of  Christ,  the  Head and Surety of the covenant and mediatorial King, and of his session at the right hand of God.

### 2.
**He proceeds in the effectual application of redemption in the use of four methods.** **(1)** By making intercession for the persons concerned. **(2)** By the revelation of the mysteries of salvation to them in his Word. **(3)** By the effectual operation of his Spirit  on  their  hearts.  **(4)**  By  all  necessary  dispensations  of  his providence. The discussion of these points must be looked for under the  several  heads  of  "The  Holy  Scripture,"  "Providence,"  "God's Covenant  with  Man,"  "Christ  the  Mediator,"  "Effectual  Calling," "Justification," etc.

### 3.
**Christ doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate redemption to ALL THOSE for whom he has purchased it.**

Our Standards, it will be observed, very explicitly teach that Christ, as  mediatorial  Priest,  made  expiation  and  purchased  salvation  for certain definite persons. Thus, in chap. 3. s. 6, it is said: "As God has appointed the elect unto glory, so has he by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, foreordained all the means thereunto. Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ. . . .  Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, . . . but the elect only." Here it is expressly affirmed (1) That Christ died upon the cross on purpose  to  carry  out  the  eternal  purpose  of  God  in  the  election  of certain  individuals  to  eternal  life.  (2)  That  Christ  died  for  the purpose of saving no other than the elect.

In  chap.  8.,  s.  5:  "The  Lord  Jesus,  by  his  perfect  obedience  and sacrifice  of  himself,  .  .  .  purchased  not  only  reconciliation,  but  an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father has given to him." Here it is expressly taught-(1) That the design of Christ in dying was not simply to make the salvation of all men possible, but actually to purchase reconciliation for those given to him by the Father. (2) That for the same persons Christ actually purchases, and consequently infallibly secures, an eternal inheritance in heaven.

In chapter 8., s. 8, it is said: "TO ALL THOSE for whom Christ has purchased  redemption,  he  certainly  and  effectually  applies and communicates  the  same."  L.  Cat.,  q.  59:  "Redemption  is  certainly applied, and effectually communicated, to all those for whom Christ has purchased it." When this Confession was written, the phrase "to purchase  redemption"  was  used  in  the  sense  in  which  we  use  the phrase "make atonement for sin." So it was so used by Baxter in his work, "Universal Redemption of Mankind by the Lord Jesus Christ"; and  by  Dr.  Isaac  Barrow  in  his  sermon  entitled  "The  Doctrine  of Universal Redemption Asserted and Explained." Dr. Henry B. Smith, in  his  edition  of  Hagenbach,  vol.  2.,  pp.  356,  357,  says  that  our Confession uses the phrase in the same sense.

The entire truth upon this subject, as set forth in our Standards, may be stated summarily in the following propositions:

- 1.  God  has  acted  from the beginning, in all his works, according to one  changeless,  all-comprehensive  plan.  Being  infinitely  wise  and powerful, his  design  is  always  fully  executed,  and  therefore  is  fully revealed in the event. God, therefore, intended to accomplish by the vicarious obedience and sufferings of Christ precisely what he does accomplish-nothing more, and nothing less.
- 2. The satisfaction rendered by Christ is amply sufficient for all men who can possibly be created.
- 3. It is exactly adapted to the legal relations and wants of every manof one man as well as of another.
- 4. Hence it has forever removed out of the way all legal obstacles to God's saving any man he wills to save.
- 5. That it is freely, authoritatively, and in good faith offered to every man to whom the gospel comes.
- 6. Hence it follows-(1) This redemption is rightfully the possession of any man whatsoever who accepts. (2) It is objectively available to one hearer of the gospel as much as to another, upon the single condition of acceptance.
- 7. But, since all men are dead in trespasses and sins, no man accepts it except those to whom it is effectually applied by the Holy Ghost.
- 8.  It  is  effectually  applied  precisely  to  those  persons  to  whom  the Father and the Son will to apply it.
- 9.  Since  God's  purposes  are  all  eternal  and  immutable,  the  Father and  the  Son  will  to  apply  it  now  precisely  to  those  to  whom  they designed  to  apply  it  when  Christ  hung  upon  the  cross,  and  they willed to apply it then precisely to those to whom they had designed to apply it from eternity.
- 10. Hence it follows-(1) Christ died with the purpose of executing the decree of election. (2) His design in making atonement was definite, having respect to certain definite persons-the elect, and none others. (3)  He  designed to secure the salvation of those for whose sake he rendered  satisfaction;  not  merely  to  make  their  salvation  possible, but  to  purchase  for  them  inalienably  faith  and  repentance,  actual reconciliation  and  the  adoption  of  sons,  etc.,  etc.  (4)  He  in  time applies it effectually and certainly to all those for whom he purchased it.

Note.-Mr. Calamy, who represented the most moderate Calvinism entertained  by  any  members  of  the  Assembly,  said  (see  Mitchell's "Minutes  of  West.  Ass.,"  ed.  AD  1874,  p.152),  "I  am  far  from universal redemption in the Arminian sense, but that I hold is in the sense of our divines in the Synod of Dort, that Christ did pay a price for all-absolute for the elect, conditional intention for the reprobate, in case  they  do  believe-that  all  men  should  be  salvibiles  non obstante lapsu Adami."
