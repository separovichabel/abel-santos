<h2 id="chapter-i">Chapter I<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-i" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Of the Holy Scripture </p>
<p>I. Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far 
manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable;' yet are 
they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of His will, which is necessary 
unto salvation.’ Therefore it pleased the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to 
reveal Himself, and to declare that His will unto His Church; and afterwards for the 
better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and 
comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of 
the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing;: which makes the Holy Scripture to </p>
<p>1 ROM 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the 
law, are a law unto themselves: 15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, 
and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another; 1:19 Because that which may be known of God is 
manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly 
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse. PSA 19:1 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork. 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto 
night sheweth knowledge. 3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. ROM 1:32 Who knowing the 
judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do 
them. 2:1 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou 
condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. </p>
<p>2 1CO 1:21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of 
preaching to save them that believe. 2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which 
the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of 
God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </p>
<p>3 HEB 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets. </p>
<p>4 PRO 22:19 That thy trust may be in the Lord, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. 20 Have not I written to thee 
excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest 
answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? LUK 1:3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all 
things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those 
things, wherein thou hast been instructed. ROM 15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, 
that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. MAT 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man 
shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. 7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, 
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship 
the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. ISA 8:19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar 
spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 20 To the 
law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. </p>
<p>be most necessary; those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being </p>
<p>now ceased.‘ </p>
<p>Il. Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained 
all the books of the Old and New Testament, which are these: </p>

<p>5 2T1 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through 
faith which is in Christ Jesus. 2PE 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as 
unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. </p>
<p>6 HEB 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2 Hath in these last 
days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds. </p>
<p>To Timothy I The first and second Epistles of Peter </p>
<p>To Timothy II The first, second, and third Epistles of 
To Titus John 
To Philemon The Epistle of Jude </p>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews The Revelation of John </p>
<p>The Epistle of James </p>
<p>All which are given by inspiration of God to be the rule of faith and life.’ </p>
<p>Il. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no 
part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, 
nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.* </p>
<p>IV. The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, and obeyed, 
depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is 
truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of 
God. </p>
<p>V. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and 
reverent esteem of the Holy Scripture. And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy 
of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the 
whole (which is, to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of 
man's salvation, the many other incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection 
thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God: 
yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth and divine </p>
<p>T LUK 16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 31 And he said unto him, If they 
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. EPH 2:20 And are built upon the 
foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone. REV 22:18 For I testify unto every man 
that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that 
are written in this book: 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his 
part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. 2TI 3:16 All scripture is 
given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. </p>
<p>8 LUK 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning 
himself. 44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be 
fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. ROM 3:2 Much every 
way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. 2PE 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the 
will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p>9 2PE 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a 
dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: 
but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2TI 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is 
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. 1JO 5:9 If we receive the witness of men, the 
witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 1 TH 2:13 For this cause also thank we 
God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but 
as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. </p>
<p>10 ITI 3:15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the 
church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. </p>
<p>authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with 
the Word in our hearts." </p>
<p>VI. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, 
man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and 
necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time 
is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.” 
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be 
necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word: and 
that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the 
Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of 
nature, and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are 
always to be observed." </p>
<p>VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all:" 
yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation 
are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only </p>
<p>11 130 2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of 
him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and 
is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. JOH 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will 
guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you 
things to come. 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. 1CO 2:10 But God hath revealed 
them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knoweth the things of a 
man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have 
received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of 
God. ISA 59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have 
put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith 
the Lord, from henceforth and for ever. </p>
<p>12 97] 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through 
faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for 
correction, for instruction in righteousness: 17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. GAL 
1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him 
be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let 
him be accursed. 2TH 2:2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from 
us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. </p>
<p>13 JOH 6:45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath 
learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 1CO 2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the 
heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for 
the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man 
which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the 
world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. </p>
<p>14100 11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, 
that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 14:26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath 
a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 40 Let all 
things be done decently and in order. </p>
<p>15 opB 3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things: in which are some things hard to be understood, which 
they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. </p>
<p>the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a 
sufficient understanding of them." </p>
<p>VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of 
God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which, at the time of the writing of it, was 
most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and, by His 
singular care and providence, kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical;” so as, in all 
controversies of religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto them." But, because these 
original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto, and interest 
in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read and search them,” 
therefore they are to be translated in to the vulgar language of every nation unto which 
they come,” that, the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in 
an acceptable manner; and, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have 
hope.” </p>
<p>IX. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and 
therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which 
is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more 
clearly.” </p>

15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written. JOH 5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have 
eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. </p>
<p>19 JOH 5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </p>
<p>20 1C0 14:6 Now, brethren, if I come undo you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either 
by revelation, or by knowledge, of by prophesying, or by doctrine? 9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to 
be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. 11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the 
voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. 12 Even so ye, forasmuch as 
ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. 24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one 
that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be 
by two, or at the most three, and that by course; and let one interpret. 28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the 
church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. </p>
<p>21 COL 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and 
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. </p>

old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. ACT 15:15 And to this agree the 
words of the prophets; as it is written, 16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen 
down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up. </p>

preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. MAT 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart 
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. </p>
<p>71 ROM 9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels 
of wrath fitted to destruction: 23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore 
prepared unto glory. EPH 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the 
good pleasure of his will, 6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. PRO 16:4 The 
Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. </p>
<p>72 2TI 2:19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let 
every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. JOH 13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but 
that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. </p>
<p>73 EPH 1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame 
before him in love: 9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed 
in himself: 11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all 
things after the counsel of his own wilL. ROM 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, 
them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. 2TI 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy 
calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the 
world began. 1TH 5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus ChrisT. </p>
<p>10 </p>
<p>perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes 
moving Him thereunto;” and all to the praise of His glorious grace.” </p>
<p>VI. As God has appointed the elect unto glory, so has He, by the eternal and most free 
purpose of His will, foreordained all the means thereunto. Wherefore, they who are 
elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ,” are effectually called unto faith 
in Christ by His Spirit working in due season, are justified, adopted, sanctified,” and kept 
by His power, through faith, unto salvation.” Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, 
effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.” </p>
<p>VII. The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of 
His own will, whereby He extends or withholds mercy, as He pleases, for the glory of 
His sovereign power over His creatures, to pass by; and to ordain them to dishonor and 
wrath for their sin, to the praised of His glorious justice.” </p>
<p>74 ROM 9:11 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to 
election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. 16 So 
then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. EPH 1:4 According as he hath chosen us 
in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. 9 Having made known 
unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself. </p>
<p>75 1PE 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and 
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. EPH 1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him 
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 5 Having predestinated us unto 
the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. 2:10 For we are his workmanship, 
created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 2TH 2:13 But we are bound 
to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation 
through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. </p>
<p>76 1TH 5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 Who died for us, that, 
whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. TIT 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all 
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. </p>
<p>77 ROM 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he 
justified, them he also glorified. EPH 1:5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, 
according to the good pleasure of his will. 2TH 2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of 
the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. </p>

<p>79 JOH 17:91 pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. ROM 8:28 And 
we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. JOH 
6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who 
should betray him. 65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my 
Father. 10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. 8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: 
ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. 1JO 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had 
been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all 
of us. </p>
<p>80 MAT 11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these 
things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. 26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. ROM 
9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, 
and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom 
he will he hardeneth. 21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another 
unto dishonour? 22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the 
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. 2TI 2:19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord 
knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 20 But in a great house there </p>

<p>VIII. The doctrine of this high mystery of predestination is to be handled with special 
prudence and care,“ that men, attending the will of God revealed in His Word, and 
yielding obedience </p>
<p>thereunto, may, from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their eternal 
election.” So shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence, and admiration of 
God;* and of humility, diligence, and abundant consolation to all that sincerely obey the 
Gospel.” </p>
<p>Chapter IV 
Of Creation </p>
<p>I. It pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for the manifestation of the glory 
of His eternal power, wisdom, and goodness,* in the beginning, to create, or make of </p>
<p>are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. JUD 4 For 
there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of 
our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. 1PE 2:8 And a stone of stumbling, and a 
rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. </p>
<p>81 ROM 9:20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast 
thou made me thus? 11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his 
judgments, and his ways past finding out! DEU 29:29 The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are 
revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </p>
<p>82 OPE 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall 
never fall. </p>
<p>83 EPH 1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. ROM 11:33 O the depth of 
the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! </p>
<p>84 ROM 11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 6 And if by grace, then is 
it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more 
work. 20 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 2PE 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give 
diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. ROM 8:33 Who shall lay any thing to 
the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. LUK 10:20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto 
you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. </p>
<p>85 HEB 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made 
the worlds. JOH 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing 
made that was made. GEN 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the 
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. JOB 26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the 
crooked serpent. 33:4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. </p>
<p>86 ROM 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that 
are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse. JER 10:12 He hath made the earth by his power, 
he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. PSA 104:24 O Lord, how 
manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 33:5 He loveth righteousness and 
judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. 6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them 
by the breath of his mouth. </p>
<p>12 </p>
<p>nothing, the world, and all things therein whether visible or invisible, in the space of six 
days; and all very good.” </p>
<p>Il. After God had made all other creatures, He created man, male and female,** with 
reasonable and immortal souls,» endued with knowledge, righteousness, and true 
holiness, after His own image;” having the law of God written in their hearts,” and power 
to fulfil it; and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their 
own will, which was subject unto change.” Beside this law written in their hearts, they 
received a command, not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; which 
while they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over 
the creatures.” </p>
<p>87 All of Genesis 1; HEB 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which 
are seen were not made of things which do appear. COL 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in 
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and 
for him. ACT 17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in 
temples made with hands. </p>
<p>88 GEN 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. </p>
<p>89 GEN 2:7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man </p>
<p>became a living soul. ECC 12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. 
LUK 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. MAT 10:28 And fear not 
them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. </p>
<p>90 GEN 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, 
and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
COL 3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. EPH 4:24 And 
that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. </p>
<p>91 ROM 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the 
law, are a law unto themselves: 15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, 
and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another. </p>
<p>92 BCC 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. </p>
<p>93 GEN 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired 
to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. ECC 7:29 Lo, 
this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. </p>
<p>94 GEN 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou 
shalt surely die. 3:8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife 
hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and 
said unto him, Where art thou? 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid 
myself. 11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou 
shouldest not eat? 23 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. </p>
<p>95 GEN 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, 
and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. </p>

<p>Chapter V </p>
<p>Of Providence </p>
<p>I. God the great Creator of all things does uphold,” direct, dispose, and govern all 
creatures, actions, and things,” from the greatest even to the least,” by His most wise and 
holy providence,” according to His infallible foreknowledge, and the free and 
immutable counsel of His own will, to the praise of the glory of His wisdom, power, 
justice, goodness, and mercy.'” </p>
<p>Il. Although, in relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, the first Cause, all 
things come to pass immutably, and infallibly;' yet, by the same providence, He orders </p>
<p>96 HEB 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his 
power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high. </p>
<p>97 DAN 4:34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto 
me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, 
and his kingdom is from generation to generation: 35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth 
according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, 
What doest thou? PSA 135:6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 
ACT 17:25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all 
things; 26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times 
before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find 
him, though he be not far from every one of us: 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own 
poets have said, For we are also his offspring. JOB 38-41. </p>
<p>98 MAT 10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 30 But 
the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. </p>
<p>99 PRO 15:3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. PSA 104:24 O Lord, how manifold are thy 
works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 145:17 The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in 
all his works. </p>

He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? 11 The Lord knoweth the 
thoughts of man, that they are vanity. </p>

things after the counsel of his own will. PSA 33:10 The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices 
of the people of none effect. 11 The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. </p>
<p>102 ISA 63:14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to 
make thyself a glorious name. EPH 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be 
known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. ROM 9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose 
have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. GEN 45:7

for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name: EXO 21:13 And if a man 
lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. DEU 19:5 As when a man

slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: 1KI 22:28 And

And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto 
the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for Iam wounded. ISA 10:6 I will send him against an 
hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread

the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and 
bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not 
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. HOS 2:21 And it

by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. JOB 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of 
understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. </p>

the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? 2SA 24:1 And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and 
he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. 1CH 21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked 
David to number Israel. 1 KI 22:22 And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit 
in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 23 Now therefore, 
behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee. 1CH 
10:4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and 
abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 2SA 16:10 And the king 
said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who 
shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? ACT 2:23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: ACT 4:27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom 
thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, 28 For to do </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>with it a most wise and powerful bounding," and otherwise ordering, and governing of 
them, in a manifold dispensation, to His own holy ends;'” yet so, as the sinfulness thereof 
proceeds only from the creature, and not from God, who, being most holy and righteous, 
neither is nor can be the author or approver of sin." </p>
<p>V. The most wise, righteous, and gracious God does oftentimes leave, for a season, 
His own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to 
chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of 
corruption and deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may be humbled;" and, to raise 
them to a more close and constant dependence for their support upon Himself, and to 
make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just 
and holy ends. </p>

turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. </p>

much people alive. ISA 10:6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a 
charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, 
neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that 
when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the

any man: 14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 17 Every good gift and every perfect 
gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 1JO 2:16 
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the 
world. PSA 50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but 
I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. </p>
<p>114 2CH 32:25 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there 
was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. </p>
<p>26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath 
of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, 
who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in 
his heart. 2SA 24:1 And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, 
number Israel and Judah. </p>

in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 8 For this thing I besought the Lord 
thrice, that it might depart from me. 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in 
weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. PSA 77:1 I cried 
unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will 
remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. (cf. MAR 
14:66-72 with JOH 21:15 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than 
these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. 16 He saith to him again the 
second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, 
Feed my sheep. 17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto 
him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith 
unto him, Feed my sheep. </p>

<p>VI. As for those wicked and ungodly men whom God, as a righteous Judge, for former 
sins, does blind and harden,'" from them He not only withholds His grace whereby they 
might have been enlightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts;'” 
but sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had,'* and exposes them to such 
objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin;'” and, withal, gives them over to their 
own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan,” whereby it comes to 
pass that they harden themselves, even under those means which God uses for the 
softening of others. </p>
<p>VII. As the providence of God does, in general, reach to all creatures; so, after a most 
special manner, it takes care of His Church, and disposes all things to the good thereof.” </p>
<p>116 ROM 1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own 
bodies between themselves. 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural 
use into that which is against nature. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a 
reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient. 11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; 
but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded 8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, 
eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. </p>

him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. </p>
<p>119 DEU 2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his 
heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. 2KI 8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? 
And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and 
their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. 13 And Hazael said, 
But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt 
be king over Syria. </p>
<p>120 pga 81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 12 So I gave them up unto their own 
hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels. 2TH 2:10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; 
because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God shall send them strong 
delusion, that they should believe a lie: 12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in 
unrighteousness. </p>
<p>121 EXO 7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 8:15 But when 
Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said. 32 And Pharaoh 
hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 2CO 2:15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in 
them that are saved, and in them that perish: 16 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life 
unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? ISA 8:14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a 
rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 1PE 2:7 Unto you therefore 
which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the 
head of the corner, 8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: 
whereunto also they were appointed. ISA 6:9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye 
indeed, but perceive not. 10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with 
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. ACT 28:26 Saying, Go unto this 
people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: 27 For the heart of this 
people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and 
hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </p>

specially of those that believe. AMO 9:8 Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from 
off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord. 9 For, lo, I will command, and I 
will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth. ROM </p>

Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and the Punishment thereof </p>
<p>I. Our first parents, being seduced by the subtilty and temptations of Satan, sinned, 
in eating the forbidden fruit.’ This their sin, God was pleased, according to His wise and 
holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to His own glory. </p>
<p>IL. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion, with God, 
and so became dead in sin,™ and wholly defiled in all the parts and faculties of soul and 
body.” </p>
<p>8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his 
purpose. ISA 43:3 For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba 
for thee. 4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for 
thee, and people for thy life. 5 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west. 14 
Thus saith the Lord, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their 
nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. </p>
<p>123 GEN 3:13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent 
beguiled me, and I did eat. 2CO 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds 
should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. </p>

desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 7 And 
the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves 
aprons. 8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid 
themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. ECC 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath 
made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. ROM 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. </p>

<p>127 TIT 1:15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind 
and conscience is defiled. GEN 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of 
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. JER 17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who 
can know it? ROM 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11 There is none that understandeth, there is none 
that seeketh after God. 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, 
no, not one. 13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 14 
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood: 16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: 
17 And the way of peace have they not known: 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes. </p>
<p>18 </p>
<p>Il. They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed; and the 
same death in sin, and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their posterity descending from 
them by ordinary generation.” </p>
<p>IV. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and 
made opposite to all good,” and wholly inclined to all evil," do proceed all actual 
transgressions.'” </p>
<p>128 GEN 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 2:10 And a 
river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 17 But of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. ACT 17:26 And 
hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, 
and the bounds of their habitation. ROM 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death 
passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. 15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one 
many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 
16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many 
offences unto justification. 17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of 
grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came 
upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 19 For 
as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 1CO 15:21 For 
since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be 
made alive. 45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. 49

ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more 
every thing living, as I have done. ROM 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11 There is none that

<p>132 JAM 1:14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15 Then when lust hath conceived, 
it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. EPH 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the 
course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 3 
Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the 
mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. MAT 15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, 
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. </p>

regenerated; and although it be, through Christ, pardoned, and mortified; yet both itself, 
and all the motions thereof, are truly and properly sin.™ </p>

God, and contrary thereunto,'* does in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner," 
whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God,” and curse of the law, and so made 
subject to death, with all miseries spiritual,” temporal," and eternal.” </p>

Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 18 For I know that in me(that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good 
thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. 23 But I see another law in my members, 
warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. JAM 3:2 For in 
many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. PRO

good, and sinneth not. </p>

fruit unto death. 7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not 
known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all 
manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I 
myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. GAL 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit 
against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. </p>

<p>Chapter VII 
Of God's Covenant with Man </p>
<p>I. The distance between God and the creature is go great, that although reasonable 
creatures do owe obedience unto Him as their Creator, yet they could never have any 
fruition of Him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on 
God's part, which He has been pleased to express by way of covenant." </p>
<p>Il. The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works,'“ wherein life was 
promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity,“ upon condition of perfect and personal 
obedience." </p>
<p>HI. Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord 
was pleased to make a second,” commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein He </p>
<p>143 ISA 40:13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counseller hath taught him? 14 With whom took he counsel, 
and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of 
understanding? 15 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh 
up the isles as a very little thing. 16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. 17 
All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. JOB 9:32 For he is not a man, as I 
am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might 
lay his hand upon us both. 1SA 2:25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the Lord, 
who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them. 
PSA 113:5 Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, 6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in 
heaven, and in the earth! PSA 100:2 Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 3 Know ye that the Lord 
he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. JOB 22:2 Can a man be 
profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? 
or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect? JOB 35:7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of 
thine hand? 8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. LUK 17:10 So 
likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done 
that which was our duty to do. ACT 17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and 
earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing 
he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things. </p>
<p>144 GAL 3:12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. </p>
<p>145 ROM 10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by 
them. ROM 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that 
all have sinned: 13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death 
reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of 
him that was to come. 15 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more 
the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 16 And not as it was by one 
that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. 17 
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of 
righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to 
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 19 For as by one man's 
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 20 Moreover the law entered, 
that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. </p>
<p>146 GEN 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou

<p>continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. </p>
<p>147 GAL 3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given 
life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. ROM 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the </p>
<p>21 </p>
<p>freely offers unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of them faith in 
Him, that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained 
unto eternal life His Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe.” </p>
<p>IV. This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in scripture by the name of a 
testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting 
inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.'» </p>
<p>V. This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time 
of the Gospel:'* under the law it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, 
circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of 
the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come; which were, for that time, sufficient and 
efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith </p>
<p>flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh. ROM 3:20 Therefore by the 
deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 21 But now the righteousness 
of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets. GEN 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee 
and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. ISA 42:6 I the Lord 
have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a 
light of the Gentiles. </p>
<p>148 MAR 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and 
is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. JOH 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only 
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. ROM 10:6 But the righteousness which 
is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) 9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, 
thou shalt be saved. GAL 3:11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by 
faith. </p>
<p>149 EZE 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of 
your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and 
ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. JOH 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and 
I will raise him up at the last day. 45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that 
hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. </p>
<p>150 HEB 9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the 
transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 16 For 
where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. 17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: 
otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. HEB 7:22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. 
LUK 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. 1CO 
11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do 
ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. </p>
<p>151 2CO 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but 
the spirit giveth life. 7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel 
could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 8 How shall not 
the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 9 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the 
ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. </p>
<p>152 SEE HEB 8-10, ROM 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet 
being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might 
be imputed unto them also. COL 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off 
the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him 
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 1CO 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye 
may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. </p>

<p>in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal 
salvation; and is called the Old Testament.' </p>
<p>VI. Under the Gospel, when Christ, the substance," was exhibited, the ordinances in 
which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of 
the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper:'<em> which, though fewer in number, and 
administered with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in them, it is held forth in 
more fullness, evidence, and spiritual efficacy,” to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles;'</em> 
and is called the New Testament.: There are not therefore two covenants of grace, 
differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations.' </p>
<p>153 1CO 10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all 
passed through the sea; 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 4 
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. HEB 
11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and 
embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. JOH 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see 
my day: and he saw it, and was glad. </p>
<p>154 GAL 3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 8 And the scripture, foreseeing 
that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be 
blessed. 9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the 
Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </p>
<p>155 COL 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. </p>
<p>156 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end 
of the world. Amen. 1CO 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same 
night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, 
which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. </p>
<p>157 HEB 12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an 
innumerable company of angels, 23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God 
the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of 
sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. 25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who 
refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 26 Whose 
voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. 27 And 
this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things 
which cannot be shaken may remain. JER 31:33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those 
days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my 
people. 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they 
shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will 
remember their sin no more. </p>
<p>158 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. EPH 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in 
himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having 
slain the enmity thereby: 17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. 18 For through 
him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but 
fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God. </p>

160 GAL 3:14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise

<p>Chapter VIII 
Of Christ the Mediator </p>
<p>I. It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, His 
only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and man," the Prophet,' Priest,'= 
and King,“ the Head and Savior of His Church, the Heir of all things,’ and Judge of 
the world: unto whom He did from all eternity give a people, to be His seed, and to be 
by Him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.” </p>
<p>the prophets; 22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is 
no difference: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. 30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the 
circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. PSA 32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is 
covered. ROM 4:3 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 6 Even as 
David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works. 16 Therefore it is of 
faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that 
also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) 
before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. 23 
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe 
on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. HEB 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. </p>
<p>161 ISA 42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall 
bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 1PE 1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without 
spot: 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. JOH 3:16 
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have 
everlasting life. 1TI 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. </p>
<p>162 ACT 3:22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like 
unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. </p>
<p>163 HEB 5:5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day 
have I begotten thee. 6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. </p>
<p>164 PSA 2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. LUK 1:33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and 
of his kingdom there shall be no end. </p>

<p>166 HEB 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made 
the worlds. </p>
<p>167 ACT 17:31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath 
ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. </p>
<p>168 JOH 17:6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest 
them me; and they have kept thy word. PSA 22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. ISA 
53:10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see 
his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. </p>
<p>169 1TI 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ISA 55:4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the 
people, a leader and commander to the people. 5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not 
thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee. 1CO 1:30 But of 
him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. </p>

<p>Il. The Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of 
one substance and equal with the Father, did, when the fullness of time was come, take 
upon Him man's nature,” with all the essential properties, and common infirmities 
thereof, yet without sin;™ being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb 
of the virgin Mary, of her substance.” So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, 
the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without 
conversion, composition, or confusion.™ Which person is very God, and very man, yet 
one Christ, the only Mediator between God and man. </p>

wisdom and knowledge; in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell,” 
to the end that, being holy, harmless, undefiled, and full of grace and truth,» He might be </p>

are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. PHI 2:6 Who, being in the form of God, 
thought it not robbery to be equal with God. GAL 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of 
a woman, made under the law. </p>
<p>171 HEB 2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that 
through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. 16 For verily he took not on him the nature of 
angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. 17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that 
he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 4:15 
For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we 
are, yet without sin. </p>

said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy 
thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. GAL 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent

came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. 1PE 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that 
he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. 1TI 3:16 And without controversy great is the 
mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on

took not unto Himself, but was thereunto called by His Father, who put all power and 
judgment into His hand, and gave Him commandment to execute the same. </p>

discharge, He was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it;<em> endured most 
grievous torments immediately in His soul, and most painful sufferings in His body;

to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. HEB 7:22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better 
testament. </p>
<p>180 HEB 5:4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. 5 So also Christ glorified not 
himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. </p>
<p>181 JOH 5:22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son. 27 And hath given him authority to 
execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. MAT 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given 
unto me in heaven and in earth. ACT 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same 
Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. </p>
<p>182 PSA 40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, 8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy 
law is within my heart. HEB 10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, 
but a body hast thou prepared me: 6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. 7 Then said I, Lo, I come(in 
the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. 8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings 
and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; 9 Then said he, Lo, I come to 
do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. 10 By the which will we are sanctified through the 
offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. JOH 10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to 
lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. PHI 2:8 And being found in 
fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. </p>
<p>183 GAL 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law. </p>

an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. MAT 27:46 And

have crucified and slain: 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should 
be holden of it. 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 13:37 But 
he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption. ROM 6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death 
hath no more dominion over him. </p>

Cephas, then of the twelve. </p>

His Father,” making intercession, and shall return, to judge men and angels, at the end

through the eternal Spirit, once offered up unto God, has fully satisfied the justice of His 
Father;'* and purchased, not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the 
kingdom of heaven, for those whom the Father has given unto Him." </p>

incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were communicated unto the 
elect, in all ages successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, </p>
<p>190 JOH 20:25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his 
hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. 27 
Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and 
be not faithless, but believing. </p>

<p>192 ROM 8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of 
God, who also maketh intercession for us. HEB 9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the 
figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us. 25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to 
the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. </p>
<p>193 ROM 14:9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. 10 But 
why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of 
Christ. ACT 1:11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up 
from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. 10:42 And he commanded us to preach 
unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. MAT 13:40 As therefore 
the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, 
and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 42 And shall cast them into a furnace 
of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. JUD 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own 
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 2PE 2:4 For if God spared not 
the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. </p>
<p>194 ROM 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made 
righteous. HEB 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, 
purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the 
death of the testator. 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. EPH 5:2 And walk in love, as 
Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. ROM 3:25 
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that 
are past, through the forbearance of God; 26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier 
of him which believeth in Jesus. </p>

prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and 
the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto 
the end of the war desolations are determined. COL 1:19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; 20 And, 
having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things 
in earth, or things in heaven. EPH 1:11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the 
purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the 
redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. JOH 17:2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he 
should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. HEB 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own 
blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. 15 And for this cause he is the mediator of 
the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which

<p>types, and sacrifices, wherein He was revealed, and signified to be the seed of the woman 
which should bruise the serpent's head; and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the 
world; being yesterday and today the same, and forever.” </p>
<p>VII. Christ, in the work of mediation, acts according to both natures, by each nature 
doing that which is proper to itself,” yet, by reason of the unity of the person, that which 
is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the person denominated by 
the other nature.” </p>
<p>VIII. To all those for whom Christ has purchased redemption, He does certainly and 
effectually apply and communicate the same;'” making intercession for them,” and 
revealing unto them, in and by the word, the mysteries of salvation;”" effectually 
persuading them by His Spirit to believe and obey, and governing their hearts by His 
word and Spirit; overcoming all their enemies by His almighty power and wisdom, in </p>
<p>196 GAL 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 5 To 
redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. GEN 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee 
and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. REV 13:8 And all that 
dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of 
the world. </p>
<p>HEB 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. </p>
<p>197 HEB 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge 
your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 1PE 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the 
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. </p>
<p>198 ACT 20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, 
to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. JOH 3:13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he 
that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 1JO 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he 
laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. </p>
<p>199 JOH 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 39 And this is 
the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last 
day. 10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 And other sheep I have, 
which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. </p>
<p>200 150 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the 
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole 
world. ROM 8:34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of 
God, who also maketh intercession for us. </p>
<p>201 JOH 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 15 Henceforth I call you not 
servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my 
Father I have made known unto you. EPH 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according 
to the riches of his grace; 8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; 9 Having made known unto us the 
mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself. JOH 17:6 I have manifested thy name unto 
the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. </p>
<p>202 JOH 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. HEB 
12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising 
the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. </p>
<p>2CO 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, 
and therefore speak. ROM 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any 
man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15:18 
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word 
and deed, 19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto </p>
<p>28 </p>
<p>such manner, and ways, as are most consonant to His wonderful and unsearchable 
dispensation. </p>
<p>Chapter IX 
Of Free Will </p>
<p>L God has endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that is neither forced, 
nor, by any absolute necessity of nature, determined good, or evil. </p>
<p>Il. Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom, and power to will and to do that 
which was good and well pleasing to God;” but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from 
1t. </p>
<p>HI. Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual 
good accompanying salvation:”” so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that 
good, and dead in sin,” is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to 
prepare himself thereunto.” </p>
<p>Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. JOH 17:17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. </p>
<p>203 PSA 110:1 The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 1CO 15:25 For he 
must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. MAL 4:2 But unto you 
that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the 
stall. 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith 
the Lord of hosts. COL 2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them 
in it. </p>
<p>204 MAT 17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they 
listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. JAM 1:14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own 
lust, and enticed. DEU 30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, 
blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live. </p>
<p>205 BCC 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. GEN 1:26 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the 
fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. </p>
<p>206 GEN 2:16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17 But of the 
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 3:6 And 
when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one 
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. </p>
<p>207 ROM 5:6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 8:7 Because the carnal mind is 
enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. JOH 15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He 
that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. </p>
<p>208 ROM 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one. 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become 
unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p>
<p>209 EPH 2:1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins. 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened </p>
<p>us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved). COL 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, 
hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses. </p>
<p>29 </p>
<p>IV. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace, He frees 
him from his natural bondage under sin; and, by His grace alone, enables him freely to 
will and to do that which is spiritually good;?” yet so, as that by reason of his remaining 
corruption, he does not perfectly, or only, will that which is good, but does also will that 
which is evil.?" </p>
<p>V. The will of man is made perfectly and immutably free to do good alone in the state 
of glory only." </p>
<p>210 JOH 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. 65 
And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. EPH 2:2 
Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that 
now worketh in the children of disobedience: 3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our 
flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 4 But God, who is 
rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, 
(by grace ye are saved;). 1CO 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto 
him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. TIT 3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, 
disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 4 But after that 
the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but 
according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p>211 COL 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. JOH 
8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 36 If the Son therefore 
shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </p>
<p>212 PHI 2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. ROM 6:18 Being then made free 
from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have 
your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. </p>
<p>213 GAL 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so 
that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ROM 7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I 
hate, that do I. 18 For I know that in me(that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to 
perform that which is good I find not. 19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 21 I find then 
a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my 
mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </p>
<p>214 EPH 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the 
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. HEB 12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written 
in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect. 1JO 3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, 
and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as 
he is. JUD 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with 
exceeding joy. </p>

<p>Chapter X 
Of Effectual Calling </p>
<p>I. All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in 
His appointed time, effectually to call," by His Word and Spirit," out of that state of sin 
and death, in which they are by nature to grace and salvation, by Jesus Christ,” 
enlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God,” 
taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh; renewing their 
wills, and, by His almighty power, determining them to that which is good, and </p>
<p>215 ROM 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he 
justified, them he also glorified. 11:7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained 
it, and the rest were blinded. EPH 1:10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in 
Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being 
predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. </p>
<p>216 9TH 2:13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the 
beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 14 Whereunto he called you by our 
gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2CO 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of 
Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the 
heart. 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the 
spirit giveth life. </p>
<p>217 ROM 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. EPH 2:1 And you 
hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; 2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, 
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 3 Among whom also we 
all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature 
the children of wrath, even as others. 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 5 Even when we 
were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved). 2TI 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with 
an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before 
the world began, 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath 
brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. </p>
<p>218 ACT 26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may 
receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 1CO 2:10 But God hath 
revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 12 Now we have received, not 
the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. EPH 1:17 
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge 
of him: 18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches 
of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. </p>
<p>219 EZE 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of 
your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. </p>
<p>220 EZE 11:19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their 
flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh. PHI 2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. 
DEU 30:6 And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine 
heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. EZE 36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my 
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. </p>
<p>31 </p>
<p>effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ: yet so, as they come most freely, being made 
willing by His grace. </p>
<p>Il. This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not from anything at all 
foreseen in man,” who is altogether passive therein, until, being quickened and renewed 
by the Holy Spirit," he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace 
offered and conveyed in it.” </p>
<p>Ill. Elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated, and saved by Christ, through the 
Spirit,” who works when, and where, and how He pleases:” so also are all other elect 
persons who are incapable of being outwardly called by the ministry of the Word.” </p>
<p>221 EPH 1:19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty 
power. JOH 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day. 
45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the 
Father, cometh unto me. </p>
<p>222 SON 1:4 Draw me, we will run after thee. PSA 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of 
holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. JOH 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; 
and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. ROM 6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, 
his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 17 But God be thanked, that 
ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 18 Being then made 
free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. </p>
<p>223 oTI 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose 
and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. TIT 3:4 But after that the kindness and love of God our 
Saviour toward man appeared, 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by 
the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. EPH 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith 
he loved us, 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved). 8 For by grace are 
ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. ROM 9:11 For 
the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, 
not of works, but of him that calleth. </p>
<p>224 1CO 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he 
know them, because they are spiritually discerned. ROM 8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to 
the law of God, neither indeed can be. EPH 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace 
ye are saved). </p>
<p>225 JOH 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. EZE 36:37 
Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men 
like a flock. JOH 5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son 
of God: and they that hear shall live. </p>
<p>226 LUK 18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked 
them. 16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the 
kingdom of God. ACT 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for 
the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to 
all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. JOH 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say 
unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except 
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 1JO 5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he 
that hath not the Son of God hath not life. ROM 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God 
dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. </p>
<p>227 JOH 3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and 
whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </p>
<p>228 1JO 5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. ACT 4:12 Neither is there salvation 
in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. </p>
<p>32 </p>
<p>IV. Others, not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the Word,” and 
may have some common operations of the Spirit,” yet they never truly come unto Christ, 
and therefore cannot be saved: much less can men, not professing the Christian religion, 
be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives 
according to the light of nature, and the laws of that religion they do profess.” And to 
assert and maintain that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested." </p>
<p>Chapter XI 
Of Justification </p>
<p>I. Those whom God effectually calls, He also freely justifies;?* not by infusing 
righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting 
their persons as righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for 
Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other 
evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing the obedience and </p>
<p>229 MAT 22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen. </p>
<p>230 MAT 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out 
devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that 
heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or 
persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. HEB 6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once 
enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 5 And have tasted the good word of 
God, and the powers of the world to come. </p>
<p>231 JOH 6:64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and 
who should betray him. 65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him 
of my Father. 66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 8:24 I said therefore unto you, 
that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. </p>
<p>232 ACT 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we 
must be saved. JOH 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
EPH 2:12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the 
covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. JOH 4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we 
worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, 
whom thou hast sent. </p>
<p>233 2JO 1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of 
Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your 
house, neither bid him God speed: 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. 1CO 16:22 If any man love 
not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. GAL 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called 
you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the 
gospel of Christ. 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached 
unto you, let him be accursed. </p>
<p>234 ROM 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he 
justified, them he also glorified. ROM 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. </p>

<p>satisfaction of Christ unto them, they receiving and resting on Him and His 
righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.» </p>
<p>Il. Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone 
instrument of justification: yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever 
accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.?* </p>
<p>Il. Christ, by His obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those that 
are thus justified, and did make a proper, real and full satisfaction to His Father's justice </p>
<p>235 ROM 4:5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 6 
Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 7 Saying, 
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute 
sin. 2CO 5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath 
committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made 
the righteousness of God in him. ROM 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all 
them that believe: for there is no difference. 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. 25 
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that 
are past, through the forbearance of God. 27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of 
faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. TIT 3:5 Not by works of righteousness 
which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. 7 
That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. EPH 1:7 In whom we have 
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. JER 23:6 In his days Judah shall be 
saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness. 1CO 1:30 But of 
him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 31 That, 
according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. ROM 5:17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; 
much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. 18 
Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift 
came upon all men unto justification of life. 19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of 
one shall many be made righteous. </p>
<p>236 ACT 10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. GAL 2:16 Knowing that 
a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might 
be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. PHI 3:9 
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the 
righteousness which is of God by faith: ACT 13:38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is 
preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: 39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be 
justified by the law of Moses. EPH 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness 
toward us through Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. </p>
<p>237 JOH 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his 
name: ROM 3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. ROM 5:1 Therefore being 
justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>238 JAM 2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by 
works was faith made perfect? 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. GAL 5:6 For in 
Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. </p>
<p>34 </p>
<p>in their behalf.» Yet, in as much as He was given by the Father for them; and His 
obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead; and both, freely, not for any thing in 
them; their justification is only of free grace; that both the exact justice, and rich grace 
of God might be glorified in the justification of sinners.’ </p>
<p>IV. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect,” and Christ did, in the 
fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, 
they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit does, in due time, actually apply Christ unto 
them.” </p>
<p>239 ROM 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, 
being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled 
to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 19 For as by one man's disobedience 
many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 1TI 2:5 For there is one God, and one 
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. HEB 10:10 
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 14 For by one offering he hath 
perfected for ever them that are sanctified. DAN 9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to 
finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting 
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall 
Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the 
end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. ISA 53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, 
and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our 
transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 6 
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. 
10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his 
seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. 11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and 
shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. 12 Therefore will I 
divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: 
and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. </p>
<p>240 ROM 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all 
things? </p>
<p>241 2CO 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 
MAT 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. EPH 5:2 And walk in love, as 
Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. </p>
<p>242 ROM 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: EPH 1:7 In whom we have 
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. </p>
<p>243 ROM 3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in 
Jesus. EPH 2:7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ 
Jesus. </p>
<p>244 GAL 3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto 
Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. 1PE 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through 
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. 
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 20 Who verily was foreordained before 
the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, ROM 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he 
also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. </p>
<p>245 GAL 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law. 1TI 2:6 
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ROM 4:25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised 
again for our justification. </p>
<p>246 COL 1:21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled 22 
In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight. GAL 2:16 Knowing 
that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we 
might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. TIT </p>
<p>35 </p>
<p>V. God does continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified;” and although 
they can never fall from the sate of justification,” yet they may, by their sins, fall under 
God's fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of His countenance restored unto them, 
until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and 
repentance.” </p>
<p>VI. The justification of believers under the Old Testament was, in all these respects, 
one and the same with the justification of believers under the New Testament.” </p>
<p>Chapter XII 
Of Adoption </p>
<p>All those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in and for His only Son Jesus Christ, 
to make partakers of the grace of adoption,“ by which they are taken into the number, </p>
<p>3:4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have 
done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 6 Which he shed 
on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the 
hope of eternal life. </p>
<p>247 MAT 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 1JO 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we 
have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 9 If we confess our sins, he is 
faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1JO 2:1 My little children, these things write I 
unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And he is the 
propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. </p>
<p>248 LUK 22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. JOH 10:28 
And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. HEB 10:14 For by 
one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. </p>
<p>249 PSA 89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, 
and their iniquity with stripes. 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to 
fail. PSA 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 8 Make me to hear joy and 
gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 10 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy 
holy spirit from me. 12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. PSA 32:5 I acknowledged my 
sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the 
iniquity of my sin. MAT 26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt 
deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. 1CO 11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many 
sleep. 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. LUK 1:20 And, 
behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my 
words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. </p>
<p>250 GAL 3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the 
law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 14 That the blessing of Abraham might 
come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. ROM 4:22 And therefore 
it was imputed to him for righteousness. 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 24 But for us 
also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. HEB 13:8 Jesus Christ the

maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. </p>

wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 18 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is 
the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 19 And what is the exceeding greatness of 
his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power. 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and

ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, 
which effectually worketh also in you that believe. 1JO 5:10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he 
that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. ACT 24:14 But this I

resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the 
covenant of grace.” </p>

assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory:** growing up in many to the attainment of a 
full assurance, through Christ, who is both the author and finisher of our faith.” </p>

ROM 4:19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, 
neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: 20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, 
giving glory to God. MAT 6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and tomorrow is cast into the 
oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? MAT 8:10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that 
followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. </p>
<p>288 LUK 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 32 But I 
have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. EPH 6:16 Above all, taking the 
shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 1JO 5:4 For whatsoever is born of God 
overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but 
he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? </p>
<p>289 HEB 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 12 That 
ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. HEB 10:22 Let us draw near with a 
true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
COL 2:2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of 
understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ. </p>
<p>290 HEB 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, 
despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. </p>

<p>Chapter XV 
Of Repentance unto Life </p>
<p>I. Repentance unto life is an evangelical grace,” the doctrine whereof is to be 
preached by every minister of the Gospel, as well as that of faith in Christ.” </p>
<p>Il. By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also of the 
filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous law of 
God; and upon the apprehension of His mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves 
for, and hates his sins, as to turn from them all unto God, purposing and endeavouring 
to walk with Him in all the ways of His commandments.” </p>
<p>291 ZEC 12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of 
supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only 
son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. ACT 11:18 When they heard these things, they 
held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. </p>
<p>292 LUK 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at 
Jerusalem. MAR 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. ACT 
20:21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>293 EZE 18:30 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent, and 
turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, 
whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 36:31 Then shall 
ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your 
iniquities and for your abominations. ISA 30:22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament 
of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. PSA 51:4 
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be 
clear when thou judgest. JER 31:18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was 
chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. 19 Surely after 
that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because 
I did bear the reproach of my youth. JOE 2:12 Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with 
fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: 13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: 
for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil. AMO 5:15 Hate the evil, and 
love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. 
PSA 119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. 2CO 7:11 For behold 
this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, 
what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved 
yourselves to be clear in this matter. </p>
<p>294 PSA 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 59 I thought on my ways, and 
turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. LUK 1:6 
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 2KI 23:25 And 
like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, 
according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. </p>
<p>41 </p>
<p>IHI. Although repentance is not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for sin, or any cause 
of the pardon thereof,» which is the act of God's free grace in Christ,» yet it is of such 
necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon without it.” </p>
<p>IV. As there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation; so there is no sin so great, 
that it can bring damnation upon those who truly repent.” </p>
<p>V. Man ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is every 
man's duty to endeavour to repent of his particular sins, particularly. </p>
<p>VI. As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God, praying for 
the pardon thereof; upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy; so, he </p>
<p>295 EZE 36:31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in 
your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 32 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto 
you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. EZE 16:61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be 
ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by 
thy covenant. 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: 63 That thou mayest 
remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all 
that thou hast done, saith the Lord God. </p>
<p>296 HOS 14:2 Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will 
we render the calves of our lips. 4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
ROM 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. EPH 1:7 In whom we have redemption 
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. </p>
<p>297 LUK 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. ACT 17:30 And the times of this ignorance God 
winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the 
world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised 
him from the dead. </p>
<p>298 ROM 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ROM 5:12 
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. 
MAT 12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. </p>
<p>299 ISA 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will 
have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. ROM 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them </p>
<p>which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ISA 1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil 
of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil. 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins 
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. </p>
<p>300 PSA 19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, 
and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. LUK 19:8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the 
half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. 1TI 
1:13 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am 
chief. </p>
<p>301 PSA 51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou 
speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 7 Purge me 
with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine 
iniquities. 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy 
righteousness. PSA 32:5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my 
transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a 
time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. </p>
<p>302 PRO 28:13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. 1JO 1:9 If 
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </p>
<p>42 </p>
<p>that scandalizes his brother, or the Church of Christ, ought to be willing, by a private or 
public confession, and sorrow for his sin, to declare his repentance to those that are 
offended," who are thereupon to be reconciled to him, and in love to receive him. </p>
<p>Chapter XVI 
Of Good Works </p>
<p>I. Good works are only such as God has commanded in His holy Word,<em> and not 
such as, without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any 
pretence of good intention.</em>* </p>
<p>Il. These good works, done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and 
evidences of a true and lively faith:*” and by them believers manifest their thankfulness, </p>
<p>303 JAM 5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of 
a righteous man availeth much. LUK 17:3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he 
repent, forgive him. 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I 
repent; thou shalt forgive him. JOS 7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, 
and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. (PSA 51 throughout) </p>
<p>304 2C0 2:8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. </p>
<p>305 MIC 6:8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love 
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? ROM 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing 
of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. HEB 13:21 Make you perfect in every 
good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever 
and ever. Amen. </p>
<p>306 MAT 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ISA 29:13 Wherefore the Lord 
said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far 
from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men. 1PE 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed 
with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers. ROM 10:2 For I 
bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. JOH 16:2 They shall put you out of the 
synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. 1SA 15:21 But the people took 
of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in 
Gilgal. 22 And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? 
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and 
stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being 
king. </p>
<p>307 JAM 2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee 
my faith by my works. 22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? </p>
<p>308 PSA 116:12 What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? 13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon 
the name of the Lord. 1PE 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should 
shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. </p>
<p>43 </p>
<p>strengthen their assurance,” edify their brethren, adorn the profession of the Gospel, 
stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God,*<em>whose workmanship they are, 
created in Christ Jesus thereunto,</em>“that, having their fruit unto holiness, they may have 
the end, eternal life. </p>
<p>Il. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the 
Spirit of Christ." And that they may be enabled thereunto, beside the graces they have 
already received, there is required an actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in 
them to will, and to do, of His good pleasure: yet are they not hereupon to grow 
negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty unless upon a special motion of 
the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.” </p>
<p>309 1JO 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him 
verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 2PE 1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your 
faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 7 
And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you 
that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, 
and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence 
to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. </p>
<p>310 2C0 9:2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a 
year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. MAT 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good 
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. </p>
<p>311 TIT 2:5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not 
blasphemed. 9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; 10 
Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 11 For the grace of 
God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live 
soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world. 1TI 6:1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters 
worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. </p>
<p>312 1 PE 2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. </p>
<p>313 IPE 2:12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by 
your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. PHI 1:11 Being filled with the fruits of 
righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. JOH 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear 
much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. </p>
<p>314 EPH 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we 
should walk in them. </p>
<p>315 ROM 6:22 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end 
everlasting life. </p>
<p>316 JOH 15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, 
except ye abide in me. 5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: 
for without me ye can do nothing. 6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, 
and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. EZE 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: 
and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my spirit within you, 
and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. </p>
<p>317 PHI 2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. 4:13 I can do all things through Christ 
which strengtheneth me. 2CO 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of 
God. </p>
<p>318 PHI 2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, </p>
<p>work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. HEB 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence 
to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit </p>
<p>44 </p>
<p>IV. They who, in their obedience, attain to the greatest height which is possibly in this 
life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that 
they fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do.” </p>
<p>V. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of 
God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come; 
and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom, by them, we can neither 
profit, nor satisfy for the debt of our former sins,”but when we have done all we can, we 
have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants:* and because, as they are good, 
they proceed from His Spirit,” and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and </p>
<p>the promises. 2PE 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the 
knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. 5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to 
virtue knowledge. 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these 
things, ye shall never fall: 11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord 
and Saviour Jesus Christ. ISA 64:7 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for 
thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 2TI 1:6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that 
thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. ACT 26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope 
of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to 
come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. JUD 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your 
most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ 
unto eternal life. </p>
<p>319 LUK 17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable 
servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. NEH 13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse 
themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this 
also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. JOB 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with 
God? 3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. GAL 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and 
the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. </p>
<p>320 ROM 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of 
sin. ROM 4:2 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. 4 Now to him that worketh is 
the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God 
imputeth righteousness without works. EPH 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of 
God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. TIT 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his 
mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 6 Which he shed on us abundantly through 
Jesus Christ our Saviour; 7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. ROM 
8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in 
us. PSA 16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee. JOB 22:2 Can a man 
be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art 
righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect? 35:7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth 
he of thine hand? 8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. </p>
<p>321 LUK 17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable 
servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. </p>
<p>322 GAL 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 meekness, temperance: 
against such there is no law. </p>
<p>45 </p>
<p>mixed with so much weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of 
God's judgment. </p>
<p>VI. Notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted through Christ, their 
good works also are accepted in Him; not as though they were in this life wholly 
unblamable and unreproveable in God's sight; but that He, looking upon them in His 
Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with 
many weaknesses and imperfections.” </p>
<p>VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them they may be 
things which God commands; and of good use both to themselves and others:<em>” yet, 
because they proceed not from an heart purified by faith; nor are done in a right 
manner, according to the Word; nor to a right end, the glory of God,</em> they are therefore </p>
<p>323 ISA 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our 
iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. GAL 5:17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and 
these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. ROM 7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for 
what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 18 For I know that in me(that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to 
will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. PSA 143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: 
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. PSA 130:3 If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? </p>
<p>324 EPH 1:6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. 1PE 2:5 Ye also, as lively 
stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. EXO 
28:38 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall 
hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord. GEN 4:4 And 
Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. 
HEB 11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was 
righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. </p>
<p>325 JOB 9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. PSA 
143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. </p>
<p>326 HEB 13:20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through

wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 2CO 8:12 For if there be first a willing 
mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. HEB 6:10 For God is not unrighteous to 
forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do 
minister. MAT 25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I 
will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful 
servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. </p>
<p>327 9KT 10:30 And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast 
done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of 
Israel. 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of 
Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. 1KI 21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put 
sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? 
because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his 
house. PHI 1:15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: PHI 1:16 The one preach Christ of 
contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds. 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, 
or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. </p>
<p>328 GEN 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. HEB 11:4 
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God 
testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to 
God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </p>

<p>Of the Perseverance of the Saints </p>
<p>I. They, whom God has accepted in His Beloved, effectually called, and sanctified 
by His Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall 
certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved. </p>
<p>Il. This perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own free will, but upon the 
immutability of the decree of election, flowing from the free and unchangeable love of </p>
<p>329 1CO 13:3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it 
profiteth me nothing. ISA 1:12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? </p>
<p>330 MAT 6:2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues 
and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 5 And when thou prayest, thou 
shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may 
be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad 
countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </p>
<p>331 HAG 2:14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so is every 
work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. TIT 1:15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are 
defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. AMO 5:21 I hate, I despise your feast days, 
and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. 22 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept 
them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. HOS 1:4 And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for 
yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of 
Israel. ROM 9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. TIT 3:15 All that 
are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen. </p>

36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good. JOB 21:14 Therefore they say unto 
God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what 
profit should we have, if we pray unto him? MAT 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye 
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, 
and ye gave me no drink: 43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye 
visited me not. 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, 
ye did it not to me. MAT 23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, 
and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the 
other undone. </p>
<p>333 PHT 1:6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus 
Christ. 2PE 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye 
shall never fall. JOH 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of 
my hand. 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. 1JO

<p>Ill. Nevertheless, they may, through the temptations of Satan and of the world, the 
prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of their 
preservation, fall into grievous sins;*<em> and, for a time, continue therein: whereby they

with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee. </p>
<p>335 HEB 10:10 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 14 For by one 
offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 20 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord 
Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 21 Make you perfect in every good work to 
do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. 
Amen. HEB 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having 
obtained eternal redemption for us. 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, 
sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered 
himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 15 And for this cause he is the 
mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, 
they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. ROM 8:33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's 
elect? It is God that justifieth. 34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at 
the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or 
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; 
we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our 
Lord. JOH 17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through 
thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. 24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast 
given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the 
foundation of the world. LUK 22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy 
brethren. HEB 7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to 
make intercession for them. </p>
<p>336 JOH 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 17 Even 
the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he 
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 1JO 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not 
that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught 
you, ye shall abide in him. 1JO 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot

<p>Chapter XVIII 
Of Assurance of Grace and Salvation </p>
<p>I. Although hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves 
with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favor of God, and estate of 
salvation** (which hope of theirs shall perish): yet such as truly believe in the Lord 
Jesus, and love Him in sincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good conscience before </p>
<p>righteousness. </p>
<p>341 ISA 64:5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art 
wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. 7 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that 
stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 9 Be not 
wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people. 2SA 11:27 And 
when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing 
that David had done displeased the Lord. </p>
<p>342 EPH 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. </p>
<p>343 PSA 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 10 Create in me a clean heart, 
O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. REV 
2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. SON 5:2 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the 
voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, 
and my locks with the drops of the night. 3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile 
them? 4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. 6 I opened to my beloved; but 
my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called 
him, but he gave me no answer. </p>
<p>344 ISA 63:170 Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' 
sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. MAR 6:52 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. 
16:14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, 
because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. </p>
<p>345 PSA 32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. 4 For day and night thy hand was 
heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones 
which thou hast broken may rejoice. </p>
<p>346 954 12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child 
also that is born unto thee shall surely die. </p>
<p>347 PSA 89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, 
and their iniquity with stripes. 1CO 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be 
condemned with the world. </p>
<p>348 JOB 8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and 
whose trust shall be a spider's web. MIC 3:11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the 
prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon 
us. DEU 29:19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have 
peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst. JOH 8:41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then 
said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. </p>

<p>Him, may, in this life, be certainly assured that they are in the state of grace, and may 
rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.” </p>
<p>Il. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion grounded upon a 
fallible hope; but an infallible assurance of faith founded upon the divine truth of the 
promises of salvation, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises 
are made,<em>“ the testimony of the Spirit of adoption witnessing with our spirits that we are 
the children of God,</em>* which Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance, whereby we are 
sealed to the day of redemption. </p>
<p>Il. This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true 
believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties, before he be partaker of it:” 
yet, being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he </p>
<p>349 MAT 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out 
devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye 
that work iniquity. </p>
<p>350 130 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 3:14 We know that we have passed from 
death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 18 My little children, let us not love 
in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts 
before him. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 24 And he that keepeth his 
commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. 
1JO 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal 
life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. </p>
<p>351 ROM 5:2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 5 
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. </p>
<p>352 HEB 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end. 19 
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil. </p>
<p>353 HEB 6:17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, 
confirmed it by an oath: 18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong 
consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. </p>
<p>354 9p E 1:4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine 
nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith 
virtue; and to virtue knowledge. 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye 
do these things, ye shall never fall: 11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of 
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 1JO 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 3:14 We 
know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 2CO 
1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but 
by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. </p>
<p>355 ROM 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby 
we cry, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. </p>
<p>356 EPH 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that </p>
<p>ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the 
purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day 
of redemption. 2CO 1:21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; 22 Who hath also sealed </p>
<p>us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. </p>
<p>357 1JO 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have 
eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. ISA 1:10 Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give 
ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. MAR 9:24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with 
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. (see PSA 88; PSA 77) </p>
<p>50 </p>
<p>may, without extraordinary revelation in the right use of ordinary means, attain 
thereunto.<strong> And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his 
calling and election sure,” that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the 
Holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the 
duties of obedience,the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to 
looseness.</strong> </p>
<p>IV. True believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers ways shaken, 
diminished, and intermitted; as, by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some 
special sin which wounds the conscience and grieves the Spirit; by some sudden or 
vehement temptation, by God's withdrawing the light of His countenance, and suffering 
even such as fear Him to walk in darkness and to have no light:*® yet are they never so </p>
<p>358 10 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that 
are freely given to us of God. 1JO 4:13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 
HEB 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 12 That ye 
be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. EPH 3:17 That Christ may dwell in your 
hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and 
length, and depth, and height; 19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the 
fulness of God. </p>
<p>359 2PE 1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye 
shall never fall. </p>
<p>360 ROM 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have 
access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because 
the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat 
and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in 
believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. EPH 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 4 According as he hath chosen us in him 
before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. PSA 4:6 There be many that say, 
Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more 
than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. 119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge 
my heart. </p>
<p>361 1JO 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the 
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole 
world. ROM 6:1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 2 God forbid. How shall we, that are 
dead to sin, live any longer therein? TIT 2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men. 12 Teaching 
us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly, in this present world. 14 Who gave 
himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. 2CO 
7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting 
holiness in the fear of God. ROM 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not 
after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 1JO 3:2 Beloved, 
now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like 
him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. PSA 130:4 But 
there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 1JO 1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in 
darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and 
the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. </p>
<p>362 SON 5:21 sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my 
dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. 3 I have put off my coat; how shall I 
put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? 6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and 
was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. PSA 51:8 
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; 
and uphold me with thy free spirit. 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall 
sing aloud of thy righteousness. EPH 4:30 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of </p>

<p>utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, 
that sincerity of heart, and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the

they are supported from utter despair. </p>

Of the Law of God </p>
<p>I. God gave to Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which He bound him and all 
his posterity, to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the 
fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and 
ability to keep it.» </p>
<p>redemption. 31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice. 
PSA 77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 2 In the day of my trouble I 
sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 3 I remembered God, and was 
troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot 
speak. 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune 
with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 8 Is 
his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up 
his tender mercies? Selah. 10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 
MAT 26:69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 70 But 
he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw 
him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 72 And again he denied with an oath, I do 
not know the man. PSA 31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of 
my supplications when I cried unto thee. (PSA 88 throughout) ISA 50:10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the 
voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. </p>
<p>363 1JO 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born 
of God. LUK 22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. JOB 
13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. PSA 73:15 If I say, I will speak 
thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children. PSA 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones 
which thou hast broken may rejoice. 12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. ISA 50:10 
Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him 
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. </p>
<p>364 MIC 7:7 Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me. 8 Rejoice not 
against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. 9 I will bear the 
indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me 
forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness. JER 32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not 
turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. ISA 54:7 For a 
small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. 8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a 
moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. 9 For this is as the waters of Noah 
unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth 
with thee, nor rebuke thee. 10 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, 
neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. PSA 22:1 My God, my God, why hast 
thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? (PSA 88 throughout) </p>
<p>365 GEN 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the 
sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 2:17 But of 
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. ROM 
2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a </p>

<p>IL. This law, after his fall, continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness; and, as 
such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten commandments, and written in two 
tables:* the first four commandments containing our duty towards God; and the other 
six, our duty to man.” </p>
<p>Ill. Besides this law, commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to the people 
of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws, containing several typical ordinances, 
partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, His graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits; and 
partly, holding forth divers instructions of moral duties. All which ceremonial laws are 
now abrogated, under the New Testament.” </p>
<p>law unto themselves: 15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their 
thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) 10:5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, 
That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. ROM 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and 
death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made 
sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. GAL 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under 
the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. 
12 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. ECC 7:29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath 
made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. JOB 28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that 
is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. </p>
<p>366 JAM 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer 
of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. 2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11 For 
he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a 
transgressor of the law. 12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. ROM 13:8 Owe no man any 
thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou 
shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, 
it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. DEU 5:32 Ye shall observe to do 
therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 10:4 And he wrote on 
the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of 
the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me. EXO 24:1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, 
thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. </p>
<p>367 MAT 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
mind. 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 40 
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. </p>
<p>368 (HEB 9) HEB 10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with </p>
<p>those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. GAL 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, 
as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time 
appointed of the father. 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. COL 2:17 Which 
are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. </p>
<p>369 10 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is 
sacrificed for us. 2CO 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean 
thing; and I will receive you, JUD 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by 
the flesh. </p>
<p>370 COL 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, 
nailing it to his cross. 16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of 
the sabbath days: 17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. DAN 9:27 And he shall confirm the 
covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the 
overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon 
the desolate. EPH 2:15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to 
make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, 
having slain the enmity thereby. </p>
<p>53 </p>
<p>IV. To them also, as a body politic, He gave sundry judicial laws, which expired 
together with the State of that people; not obliging under any now, further than the 
general equity thereof may require.’ </p>
<p>V. The moral law does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the 
obedience thereof;*” and that, not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in 
respect of the authority of God the Creator, who gave it.’ Neither does Christ, in the 
Gospel, any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.” </p>
<p>VI. Although true believers be not under the law, as a covenant of works, to be thereby 
justified, or condemned;:” yet is it of great use to them, as well as to others; in that, as a 
rule of life informing them of the will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to </p>
<p>371 (EXO 21-22) GEN 49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; 
and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 1PE 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: 
whether it be to the king, as supreme; 14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and 
for the praise of them that do well. MAT 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to 
destroy, but to fulfil. 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That 
ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 1CO 9:8 Say I these things as a 
man? or saith not the law the same also? 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that 
treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is 
written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. </p>
<p>372 ROM 13:8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 9 For this, Thou 
shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if 
there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 10 
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. EPH 6:2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is 
the first commandment with promise;) 1JO 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He 
that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 7 Brethren, I write no new 
commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye 
have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the 
darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. </p>
<p>373 JAM 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11 For he that said, Do not 
commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. </p>
<p>374 MAT 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I 
say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 19 Whosoever 
therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of 
heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. JAM 2:8 If ye fulfil the 
royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well. ROM 3:31 Do we then make void the 
law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. </p>
<p>375 ROM 6:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. GAL 2:16 Knowing that a 
man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might 
be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 3:13 
Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on 
a tree. 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 5 To redeem 
them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. ACT 13:39 And by him all that believe are justified from 
all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. ROM 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them 
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. </p>
<p>54 </p>
<p>walk accordingly; discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts and 
lives; so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, 
humiliation for, and hatred against sin,” together with a clearer sight of the need they 
have of Christ, and the perfection of His obedience.<em>” It is likewise of use to the 
regenerate, to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin: and the threatenings of it 
serve to show what even their sins deserve; and what afflictions, in this life, they may 
expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law.</em>'The 
promises of it, in like manner, show them God's approbation of obedience,and what 
blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof:* although not as due to them </p>
<p>376 ROM 7:12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. 22 For I delight in the law of God after 
the inward man. 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the 
flesh the law of sin. PSA 119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 5 O that my ways were directed to keep 
thy statutes! 6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 1CO 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, 
and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. GAL 5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, 
even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulful the lust of the 
flesh. 18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; 
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, 
heresies, 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in 
time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, 
longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. </p>
<p>377 ROM 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known 
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. ROM 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in 
his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. </p>
<p>378 JAM 1:23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 24 For 
he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 25 But whoso looketh into the 
perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in 
his deed. ROM 7:9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 14 For we 
know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of 
this death? </p>
<p>379 GAL 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. ROM 7:24 O 
wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then 
with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was 
weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: ROM 8:4 
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. </p>
<p>380 JAM 2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, 
thou art become a transgressor of the law. PSA 119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. 
104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. 128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning 
all things to be right; and I hate every false way. </p>
<p>381 EZR 9:13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast 
punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; 14 Should we again break thy 
commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst 
consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? PSA 89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my 
judgments; 31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and 
their iniquity with stripes. 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 34 
My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. </p>
<p>382 (LEV 26) 2CO 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God 
hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. EPH 6:2 Honour thy father 
and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) 3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the 
earth. PSA 37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. MAT 5:5 Blessed 
are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. PSA 19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is 
great reward. </p>
<p>55 </p>
<p>by the law as a covenant of works.* So as, a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, 
because the law encourages to the one and deters from the other, is no evidence of his 
being under the law: and not under grace. </p>
<p>VII. Neither are the forementioned uses of the law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, 
but do sweetly comply with it;* the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of 
man to do that freely, and cheerfully, which the will of God, revealed in the law, requires 
to be done. </p>
<p>Chapter XX 
Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience </p>
<p>I. The liberty which Christ has purchased for believers under the Gospel consists in 
their freedom from the guilt of sin, and condemning wrath of God, the curse of the moral 
law;<em> and, in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and 
dominion of sin;</em>* from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the victory of the grave, </p>
<p>383 GAL 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed 
in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall </p>
<p>no flesh be justified. LUK 17:10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are 
unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. </p>
<p>384 ROM 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 14 For sin shall not have 
dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. 1PE 3:8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of 
another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; 
knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. 10 For he that ill love life, and see good days, let him refrain 
his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. 
12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them 
that do evil. PSA 34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? 13 Keep thy tongue from 
evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 15 The eyes of the Lord are 
upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 16 The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the 
remembrance of them from the earth. HEB 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, 
whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. 29 For our God is a consuming fire. </p>
<p>385 GAL 3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given 
life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. </p>
<p>386 EZE 36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do 
them. HEB 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my 
laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. JER 31:33 But 
this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their 
inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. </p>
<p>387 TIT 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, 
zealous of good works. 1TH 1:10 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered 
us from the wrath to come. GAL 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is 
written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree. </p>
<p>388 GAL 1:4 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and 
our Father. COL 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. 
ACT 26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may 
receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. ROM 6:14 For sin shall not </p>
<p>56 </p>
<p>and everlasting damnation; as also, in their free access to God, and their yielding 
obedience unto Him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.» All 
which were common also to believers under the law.*” But, under the New Testament, 
the liberty of Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of the 
ceremonial law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected; and in greater boldness of 
access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, 
than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.” </p>
<p>Il. God alone is Lord of the conscience,” and has left it free from the doctrines and 
commandments of men, which are, in any thing, contrary to His Word; or beside it, in 
matters of faith, or worship.*” So that, to believe such doctrines, or to obey such </p>
<p>have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. </p>
<p>389 ROM 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to 
his purpose. PSA 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 1CO 15:54 So when this 
corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying 
that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 56 The sting of 
death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the 
Spirit. </p>
<p>390 ROM 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have 
access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. </p>
<p>391 ROM 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15 For ye have not received the spirit of 
bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 1JO 4:18 There is no fear in 
love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. </p>
<p>392 GAL 3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on 
the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. </p>
<p>393 GAL 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 2 But is 
under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the 
elements of the world. 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 7 
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the 
liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. ACT 15:10 Now therefore why 
tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we believe 
that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. </p>
<p>394 HEB 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast 
our profession. 16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time 
of need. 10:19 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20 By a new and living way, 
which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 21 And having an high priest over the house of God; 22 
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies 
washed with pure water. </p>
<p>395 JOH 7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. 39 (But this 
spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was 
not yet glorified.) 2CO 3:13 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to 
the end of that which is abolished. 17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, 
with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the 
Spirit of the Lord. </p>

make him stand. </p>

of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of 
conscience, and reason also.*” </p>

lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty, which is, that being delivered out of 
the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and 
righteousness before Him, all the days of our life.“ </p>

purchased are not intended by God to destroy, but mutually to uphold and preserve one 
another, they who, upon pretence of Christian liberty, shall oppose any lawful power, or 
the lawful exercise of it, whether it be civil or ecclesiastical, resist the ordinance of 
God. And, for their publishing of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices, as are </p>

7:23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. MAT 23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even 
Christ; and all ye are brethren. 9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 10 Neither 
be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. 2CO 1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers 
of your joy: for by faith ye stand. MAT 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </p>
<p>398 COL 2:20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye 
subject to ordinances, 22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? 23 Which things 
have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the 
flesh. GAL 1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the 
servant of Christ. 2:4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we 
have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 5 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the 
truth of the gospel might continue with you. 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not 
entangled again with the yoke of bondage. </p>
<p>399 ROM 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 14:23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, 
because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. ISA 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not 
according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. ACT 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that 
they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. JOH 4:22 Ye 
worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. HOS 5:11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in 
judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. REV 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast 
before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 16 And 
he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. JER 8:9 The 
wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them? </p>
<p>400 GAL 5:13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve 
one another. 1PE 2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 2PE 2:19 While 
they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he 
brought in bondage. JOH 8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
LUK 1:74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, 75 In 
holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. </p>

and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. 1PE 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's 
sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of 
evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the 
servants of God. ROM 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be 
are ordained of God. 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to 
themselves damnation. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that

concerning faith, worship, or conversation), or to the power of godliness; or, such 
erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in the manner of 
publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace and order which

evil. 5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 6 For for this cause pay ye tribute 
also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom 
tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one 
another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. HEB 13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:

unprofitable for you. </p>
<p>402 ROM 1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, 
but have pleasure in them that do them. 1CO 5:1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication 
as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the 
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 11 But now I have written unto you not to keep 
company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; 
with such an one no not to eat. 13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked 
person. 2JO 1:10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God 
speed: 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds. 2TH 3:14 And if any man obey not our word by this 
epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. 1TI 6:3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent 
not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 4 He is 
proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5 
Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw 
thyself. TIT 1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 11 Whose mouths 
must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 13 This witness is true. 
Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith. TIT 3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second 
admonition reject. MAT 18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him 
alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in 
the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. 17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: 
but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. 1TI 1:19 Holding faith, and a good

patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and 
hast found them liars. 14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who 
taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. 15 
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against 
thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit 
fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are 
Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. </p>

<p>I. The light of nature shows that there is a God, who has lordship and sovereignty 
over all, is good, and does good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, 
called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all 
the might. But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Himself, 
and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not be worshipped according to the </p>
<p>bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is 
partaker of his evil deeds. EZR 7:23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the 
God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of 
thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as 
know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. 26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law 
of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or 
to imprisonment. 27 Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the 
house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem: 28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellers, and before all 
the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of 
Israel chief men to go up with me. REV 17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no 
kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these 
shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. 17 For God hath put in 
their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. NEH 
13:15 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also 
wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against 
them in the day wherein they sold victuals. 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is 
this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if 
ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. 22 And I commanded the Levites 
that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O 
my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. 25 And I contended with them, and cursed 
them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters 
unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. 30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and 
appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business. 2KI 23:5 And he put down the idolatrous priests, 
whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about 
Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. 6 
And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook 
Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 9 Nevertheless 
the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among 
their brethren. 20 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, 
and returned to Jerusalem. 21 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God, as it is 
written in the book of this covenant. 2CH 34:33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to 
the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his days they 
departed not from following the Lord, the God of their fathers. 2CH 15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God 
of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 13 That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put 
to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 16 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto 
him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that 
God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. DAN 3:29 Therefore I 
make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and 
Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after 
this sort. 1 TI 2:2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and 
honesty. ISA 49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with 
their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed 
that wait for me. ZEC 13:2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols 
out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the 
land. 3 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto 
him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust

with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. </p>
<p>415 ICO 14:14 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
416 1JO 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us. </p>
<p>417 1TI 2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2 
For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. JOH 17:20 
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word. 2SA 7:29 Therefore now let it 
please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it: and 
with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. RUT 4:12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom 
Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman. </p>
<p>418 2SA 12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, 
while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I 
fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the child may live? 23 But now he is dead, 
wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. LUK 16:25 But Abraham said, 
Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and 
thou art tormented. 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence 
to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. REV 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto 
me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; </p>
<p>62 </p>
<p>reverence,” singing of psalms with grace in the heart; as also, the due administration 
and worthy receiving of the sacraments instituted by Christ, are all parts of the ordinary 
religious worship of God: beside religious oaths,’ vows,“ solemn fastings,” and 
thanksgivings upon special occasions,” which are, in their several times and seasons, to 
be used in an holy and religious manner.” </p>
<p>VI. Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worship, is now, under the Gospel, 
either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or </p>
<p>and their works do follow them. </p>
<p>419 1JO 5:16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin 
not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. </p>
<p>420 ACT 15:21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. 
REV 1:3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: 
for the time is at hand. </p>
<p>421 2TI 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. </p>
<p>422 JAM 1:22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. ACT 10:33 Immediately therefore I 
sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that 
are commanded thee of God. MAT 13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh 
the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. HEB 4:2 For 
unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in 
them that heard it. ISA 66:2 For all those things hath mine hand made, and those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man 
will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. </p>
<p>423 COL 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and 
hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. EPH 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns 
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. JAM 5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is 
any merry? let him sing psalms. </p>
<p>424 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost: 1CO 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in 
which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is 
broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This 
cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, 
and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the 
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that 
bread, and drink of that cup. ACT 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of 
bread, and in prayers. </p>
<p>425 DBU 6:13 Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. NEH 10:29 They clave to their 
brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of 
God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes. </p>
<p>426 ISA 19:21 And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and 
oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. ECC 5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; 
for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest 
vow and not pay. </p>
<p>427 JOE 2:12 Therefore also now, saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and 
with mourning. EST 4:16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink 
three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the 
law: and if I perish, I perish. MAT 9:15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the </p>
<p>63 </p>
<p>towards which it is directed: but God is to be worshipped everywhere,*" in spirit and 
truth; as, in private families daily, and in secret, each one by himself; so, more 
solemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or wilfully to be neglected, or 
forsaken, when God, by His Word or providence, calls thereunto.» </p>
<p>VII. As it is the law of nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time be set apart for 
the worship of God; so, in His Word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual commandment 
binding all men in all ages, He has particularly appointed one day in seven, for a </p>
<p>bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 1CO 7:5 
Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come 
together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. </p>
<p>428 (PSA 107 throughout) EST 9:22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned 
unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of 
sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. </p>
<p>429 HEB 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God 
acceptably with reverence and godly fear. </p>
<p>430 JOH 4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at 
Jerusalem, worship the Father. </p>
<p>431 MAL 1:11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; 
and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith 
the Lord of hosts. 1TI 2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. </p>
<p>432 JOH 4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the 
Father seeketh such to worship him. 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. </p>
<p>433 JER 10:25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they 
have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. DEU 6:6 And these words, 
which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of 
them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. JOB 
1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the 
morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and 
cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually. 2SA 6:18 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings 
and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts. 20 Then David returned to bless his household. And 
Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself 
to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 1PE 3:7 Likewise, 
ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs 
together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. ACT 10:2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his 
house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. </p>
<p>434 MAT 6:11 Give us this day our daily bread. </p>
<p>435 MAT 6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in 
secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. EPH 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in 
the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. </p>
<p>436 ISA 56:6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be 
his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 7 Even them will I bring to my 
holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine </p>

<p>Sabbath, to be kept holy unto him:+” which, from the beginning of the world to the 
resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week: and, from the resurrection of Christ, 
was changed into the first day of the week,** which, in Scripture, is called the Lord's 
Day, and is to be continued to the end of the world, as the Christian Sabbath.«° </p>
<p>VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due preparing of 
their hearts, and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an 
holy rest, all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly </p>
<p>altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. HEB 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves 
together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. PRO 1:20 
Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the 
gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying. 24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no 
man regarded. 8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. ACT 13:42 
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next 
sabbath. LUK 4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue 
on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. ACT 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and 
in breaking of bread, and in prayers. </p>
<p>437 EXO 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that 
is within thy gates: 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: 
wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. ISA 56:2 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that 
layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. 4 For thus saith the Lord 
unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant. 6 Also the sons of the 
stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be his servants, every one that keepeth 
the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them 
joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be 
called an house of prayer for all people. </p>
<p>438 GEN 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work 
which he had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which 
God created and made. 1CO 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, 
even so do ye. 2 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be 
no gatherings when I come. ACT 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul 
preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. </p>
<p>439 REV 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet. </p>
<p>440 EXO 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that 
is within thy gates. MAT 5:17 Think not that Iam come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. </p>

private exercises of His worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.” </p>
<p>Chapter XXII 
Of Lawful Oaths and Vows </p>
<p>I. A lawful oath is part of religious worship, wherein, upon just occasion, the 
person swearing solemnly calls God to witness what he asserts, or promises, and to judge 
him according to the truth or falsehood of what he swears.“ </p>
<p>Il. The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be 
used with all holy fear and reverence. Therefore, to swear vainly, or rashly, by that 
glorious and dreadful Name; or, to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be </p>
<p>44] EXO 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. EXO 16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath 
said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; 
and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a 
sabbath unto the Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the 
sabbath, in it there shall be none. 29 See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the 
bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 30 So the people rested on 
the seventh day. 31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any 
work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the 
sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in 
six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. ISA 58:13 If thou turn away thy 
foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; 
and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words. NEH 13:15 In 
those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, 
grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in 
the day wherein they sold victuals. 16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold 
on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, 
What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil 
upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath. 19 And it came to pass, that when the 
gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should 
not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the 
sabbath day. 21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands 
on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse 
themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this 
also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. </p>
<p>4421s 4 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, 
the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking 
thine own words. </p>
<p>443 DEU 10:20 Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. </p>
<p>444 EXO 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his 
name in vain. LEV 19:12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the 
Lord. 2CO 1:23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 2CH 6:22 If a 
man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; 
23 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own 
head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness. </p>

<p>abhorred.<strong> Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an oath is warranted by the Word of 
God, under the New Testament as well as under the old;⁄ so a lawful oath, being 
imposed by lawful authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.</strong> </p>
<p>IHI. Whosoever takes an oath ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an 
act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully persuaded is the truth:<em> neither 
may any man bind himself by oath to any thing but what is good and just, and what he 
believes so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.</em>” Yet it is a sin to refuse 
an oath touching any thing that is good and just, being imposed by lawful authority.“ </p>
<p>IV. An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without 
equivocation, or mental reservation.” It cannot oblige to sin; but in any thing not sinful, </p>
<p>446 EXO 20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his 
name in vain. JER 5:7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when 
I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. MAT 5:34 But 
I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne. 37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: 
for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. JAM 5:12 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, 
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. </p>
<p>447 HEB 6:16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. 2CO 1:23 Moreover 
I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. ISA 65:16 That he who blesseth himself in 
the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the 
former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. </p>

before thine altar in this house. NEH 13:25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked 
off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto 
your sons, or for yourselves. EZR 10:5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they 
should do according to this word. And they sware. </p>

under my thigh: 3 And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a 
wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell. 5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the 
woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 6 
And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 8 And if the woman will not be willing to 
follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 9 And the servant put his hand under 
the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. </p>

Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord make thee a 
curse and an oath among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. NEH 5:12 Then said they, 
We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of

<p>454 EZE 17:16 As I live, saith the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he 
despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. 18 Seeing he despised the oath by 
breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape. 19 Therefore thus saith 
the Lord God; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense 
upon his own head. JOS 9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto 
them by the Lord God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 19 But all the princes said unto all the 
congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. 2SA 21:1 Then there 
was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the Lord. And the Lord answered, It is for 
Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. </p>
<p>455 ISA 19:21 And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and 
oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. ECC 5:4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; 
for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest 
vow and not pay. 6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore 
should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? PSA 61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that 
I may daily perform my vows. 66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 14 Which my lips have 
uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. </p>
<p>456 PSA 76:11 Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be 
feared. JER 44:25 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, 
and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, 
and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 26 Therefore hear ye 
the word of the Lord, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my 
name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord God liveth. </p>
<p>457 DEU 23:21 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely 
require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. 22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 23 That which is gone 
out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God, which 
thou hast promised with thy mouth. PSA 50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High. GEN 28:20 
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and 
raiment to put on, 21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: 22 And this stone, which I 
have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. ISA 1:11 And 
she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and 
not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, </p>
<p>68 </p>
<p>VII. No man may vow to do any thing forbidden in the Word of God, or what would 
hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in his own power, and for the 
performance whereof he has no promise of ability from God.*<em> In which respects, popish 
monastical vows of perpetual single life, professed poverty, and regular obedience, are so 
far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, 
in which no Christian may entangle himself.+</em> </p>
<p>Chapter XXIII 
Of the Civil Magistrate </p>
<p>I. God, the supreme Lord and King of all the world, has ordained civil magistrates, 
to be, under Him, over the people, for His own glory, and the public good: and, to this 
end, has armed them with the power of the sword, for the defence and encouragement of 
them that are good, and for the punishment of evil doers.“ </p>
<p>and there shall no rasor come upon his head. PSA 66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 14 
Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 132:2 How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed 
unto the mighty God of Jacob; 3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 4 I will not give 
sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 5 Until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. </p>
<p>458 ACT 23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they 
would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. 14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound 
ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul. MAR 6:26 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet 
for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. NUM 30:5 But if her father disallow her in the 
day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive 
her, because her father disallowed her. 8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow 
which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the Lord shall 
forgive her. 12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her 
lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the Lord shall 
forgive her. 13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it 
void. </p>
<p>459 MAT 19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. 12 For there are some 
eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there 
be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. 
1CO 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 9 But if 
they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. EPH 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let 
him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. 1PE 4:2 That he no

<p>460 ROM 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained 
of God. 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves 
damnation. 3 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is 
good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be 
afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. 
1PE 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 14 Or unto 
governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. </p>

<p>Il. It is lawful for Christians to accept and execute the office of a magistrate, when 
called thereunto: in the managing whereof, as they ought especially to maintain piety, 
justice, and peace, according to the wholesome laws of each commonwealth; so, for 
that end, they may lawfully, now under the New Testament, wage war, upon just and 
necessary occasion.* </p>
<p>Il. The civil magistrate may not assume to himself the administration of the Word and 
sacraments, or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven:<em>“ yet he has authority, 
and it is his duty, to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the Church, that the 
truth of God be kept pure and entire, that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all 
corruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevented or reformed, and all the 
ordainances of God duly settled, administrated, and observed.</em>* For the better effecting </p>

damnation. 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword

all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. PSA 82:3 Defend the poor and 
fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. 4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 2SA 23:3 
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. 1PE 2:13 
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme. </p>
<p>463 LUK 3:14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to 
no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. ROM 13:4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But 
if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute 
wrath upon him that doeth evil. MAT 8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and 
he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, 
and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. ACT 10:1 There was a 
certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band, 2 A devout man, and one that feared God 
with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. REV 17:14 These shall make war with the 
Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and 
chosen, and faithful. 16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her 
desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. </p>
<p>464 2CH 26:18 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto 
the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; 
neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God. MAT 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but 
if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. MAT 16:19 And I will give unto thee the 
keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 1CO 12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly 
teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? 
are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? EPH 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; 
and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of 
Christ. 1CO 4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 2 Moreover it is 
required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. ROM 10:15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,

<p>465 ISA 49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their

<p>IV. Itis the duty of people to pray for magistrates,” to honor their persons, to pay 
them tribute or other dues,” to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to their 
authority, for conscience’ sake.*” Infidelity, or difference in religion, does not make void 
the magistrates’ just and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to 
them:‘” from which ecclesiastical persons are not exempted,” much less has the Pope any 
power and jurisdiction over them in their dominions, or over any of their people; and, </p>
<p>judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. 26 And 
whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto 
death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. 27 Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put 
such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem: 28 And hath extended mercy unto 
me before the king, and his counsellers, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord 
my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. LEV 24:16 And he that blasphemeth the 
name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that 
is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death. DEU 13:5 And that prophet, or that dreamer 
of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the 
land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded 
thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee. 6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy 
daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other 
gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers. 12 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God hath 
given thee to dwell there, saying, etc. 2KI 18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and 
brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he 
called it Nehushtan. (1CH 13:1-8; 2KI 24:1-25) 2CH 34:33 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that 
pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all his 
days they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their fathers. 2CH 15:12 And they entered into a covenant to seek the 
Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 13 That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel 
should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. </p>
<p>466 2CH 19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, 
for the judgment of the Lord, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. 9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye 
do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that 
dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them 
that they trespass not against the Lord, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. 11 
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house

good. (2CH 29-30) MAT 2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of

Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be 
judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest. 11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing 
worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto 
them. I appeal unto Caesar. 2PE 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers 
among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves 
swift destruction. 10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous 
are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring 
not railing accusation against them before the Lord. JUD 8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, 
and speak evil of dignities. JUD 9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of 
Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee. 10 But these speak evil of those things 
which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. 11 Woe unto them! 
for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of 
Core. </p>

<p>482 MAR 6:18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. LEV 18:24 Defile not ye 
yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 25 And the land is defiled: 
therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 26 Ye shall therefore keep my 
statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that 
sojourneth among you: 27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is 
defiled;) 28 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you. </p>
<p>483 LEV 20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his 
near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. 20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: 
they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath 
uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. </p>
<p>73 </p>
<p>V. Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected before marriage, 
gives just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract. In the case of adultery 
after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce and, after the 
divorce,<strong> to marry another, as if the offending party were dead.</strong> </p>
<p>VI. Although the corruption of man be such as is apt to study arguments unduly to put 
asunder those whom God has joined together in marriage: yet, nothing but adultery, or 
such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied by the Church, or civil magistrate, is 
cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of marriage: wherein, a public and orderly 
course of proceeding is to be observed; and the persons concerned in it not left to their 
own wills, and discretion, in their own case. </p>
<p>Chapter XXV 
Of the Church </p>
<p>I. The catholic or universal Church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number 
of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head 
thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of Him that fills all in all.” </p>
<p>484 MAT 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they 
came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make 
her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord 
appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p>485 MAT 5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 32 But I say unto </p>
<p>P y g g y 
you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever 
shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. </p>
<p>486 MAT 19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, 
committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. ROM 7:2 For the woman which hath an 
husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her 
husband. 3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband 
be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. </p>
<p>487 MAT 19:8 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from 
the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry 
another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. 1CO 7:15 But if the unbelieving 
depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace. MAT 19:6 
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. </p>
<p>488 DEU 24:1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he 
hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his 
house. 2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. 3 And if the latter husband hate her, 
and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which 
took her to be his wife; 4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; 
for that is abomination before the Lord: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an 
inheritance. </p>
<p>489 EPH 1:10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in 
heaven, and which are on earth; even in him. 22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things </p>
<p>74 </p>
<p>Il. The visible Church, which is also catholic or universal under the Gospel (not 
confined to one nation, as before under the law), consists of all those throughout the 
world that profess the true religion; and of their children:*' and is the kingdom of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, out of which there is no ordinary 
possibility of salvation.“ </p>
<p>Il. Unto this catholic visible Church Christ has given the ministry, oracles, and 
ordinances of God, for the gathering and perfecting of the saints, in this life, to the end of 
the world: and does, by His own presence and Spirit, according to His promise, make 
them effectual thereunto.” </p>
<p>to the church, 23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as 
Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not 
having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak 
concerning Christ and the church. COL 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from 
the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. </p>
<p>490 1CO 1:2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all 
that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours. 1CO 12:12 For as the body is one, and hath 
many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit are we all 
baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one 
Spirit. PSA 2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy 
possession. REV 7:9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and 
people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands. ROM 15:9 
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and 
sing unto thy name. 10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; 
and laud him, all ye people. 12 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the 
Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. </p>
<p>491 ICO 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else 
were your children unclean; but now are they holy. ACT 2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are 
afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. EZE 16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou 
hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, 21 That thou 
hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them? ROM 11:16 For if the firstfruit be holy, 
the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. GEN 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, 
and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 17:7 And I will establish my covenant 
between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed 
after thee. </p>
<p>492 MAT 13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind. ISA 9:7 Of 
the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to 
establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. </p>
<p>493 EPH 2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of 
God. 3:15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. </p>
<p>494 ACT 2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be 
saved. </p>
<p>495 1CO 12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then 
gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. EPH 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, 
evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the 
body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the 
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, 
I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. ISA 59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord; 
My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of 
thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever. </p>
<p>75 </p>
<p>IV. This catholic Church has been sometimes more, sometimes less visible.“ And 
particular Churches, which are members thereof, are more or less pure, according as the 
doctrine of the Gospel is taught and embraced, ordinances administered, and public 
worship performed more or less purely in them.*” </p>
<p>V. The purest Churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error; and 
some have so degenerated, as to become no Churches of Christ, but synagogues of 
Satan.” Nevertheless, there shall be always a Church on earth to worship God according 
to His will. </p>
<p>VI. There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ.*" Nor can the Pope 
of Rome, in any sense, be head thereof. but is that Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of 
perdition, that exalts himself, in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God.” </p>
<p>496 ROM 11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 4 But 
what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image 
of Baal. REV 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her 
there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly 
into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. </p>
<p>497 (REV 2-3 throughout) 1CO 5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 7 Purge 
out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. </p>
<p>498 1CO 13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as 
also I am known. MAT 13:24-30, 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of 
every kind. </p>
<p>499 REV 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation 
of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. ROM 11:18 Boast not against the 
branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. 19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I 
might be graffed in. 20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 21 
For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of 
God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. </p>
<p>500 MAT 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall 
not prevail against it. PSA 72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be 
blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. 102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be 
established before thee. MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you 
alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. </p>
<p>501 COL 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he 
might have the preeminence. EPH 1:22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the 
church. </p>
<p>502 MAT 23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. 9 And call no man your 
father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even 
Christ. 2TH 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that 
man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is 
worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 8 And then shall that Wicked be 
revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: 9 Even 
him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders. REV 13:6 And he opened his mouth 
in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. </p>
<p>76 </p>
<p>Chapter XXVI </p>
<p>Of the Communion of Saints </p>
<p>I. All saints, that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by His Spirit, and by faith, 
have fellowship with Him in His grace, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory:<em> and, 
being united to one another in love, they have communion in each other's gifts and 
graces, and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do 
conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.</em> </p>
<p>Il. Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in 
the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their 
mutual edification; as also in relieving each other in outward things, according to their 
several abilities and necessities. Which communion, as God offers opportunity, is to be 
extended unto all those who, in every place, call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.” </p>
<p>503 1JO 1:3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our 
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. EPH 3:16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his 
glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being 
rooted and grounded in love, 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 
19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. JOH 1:16 And of 
his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. EPH 2:5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with 
Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. PHI 
3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto 
his death. ROM 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his 
resurrection: 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we 
should not serve sin. 2TI 2:12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us. </p>
<p>504 EPH 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 16 From whom 
the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the 
measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. 1CO 12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit 
is given to every man to profit withal. 1CO 3:21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 22 Whether Paul, or 
Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 23 And ye are Christ's; and 
Christ is God's. COL 2:19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, 
and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. </p>
<p>505 1TH 5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. 14 Now we exhort you, brethren, 
warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. ROM 1:11 For I long to see 
you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 12 That is, that I may be comforted together 
with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to 
the unwise. 1JO 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives 
for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion 
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in 
truth. GAL 6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of 
faith. </p>
<p>506 HEB 10:24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 25 Not forsaking the assembling of 
ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. 
ACT 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 46 And 
they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and 
singleness of heart. ISA 2:3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house 
of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the 
word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 1CO 11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. </p>
<p>507 ACT 2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and 
parted them to all men, as every man had need. 1JO 3:17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and </p>
<p>77 </p>
<p>Il. This communion which the saints have with Christ, does not make them in any 
wise partakers of the substance of His Godhead; or to be equal with Christ in any respect: 
either of which to affirm is impious and blasphemous.<em> Nor does their communion one 
with another, as saints, take away, or infringe the title or propriety which each man has in 
his goods and possessions.</em>” </p>
<p>Chapter XXVII </p>
<p>Of the Sacraments </p>
<p>I. Sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace,*"immediately 
instituted by God," to represent Christ and His benefits; and to confirm our interest in 
Him: as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the Church and </p>
<p>shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? (2CO 8-9) ACT 11:29 Then the disciples, 
every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: 30 Which also they did, and 
sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. </p>
<p>508 COL 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he 
might have the preeminence. 19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell. 1CO 8:6 But to us there is but one 
God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. ISA 
42:8 I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 1 TI 6:15 Which 
in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 16 Who only hath 
immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and 
power everlasting. Amen. PSA 45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee 
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. HEB 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of 
righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, 
hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. </p>
<p>509 EXO 20:15 Thou shalt not steal. EPH 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands 
the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. ACT 5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after 
it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto 
God. </p>
<p>510 ROM 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being 
uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be 
imputed unto them also. GEN 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their 
generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 10 This is my covenant, which ye shall 
keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. </p>
<p>511 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. 1CO 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in 
which he was betrayed took bread. </p>
<p>512 1CO 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is 
it not the communion of the body of Christ? 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This 
cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, </p>
<p>and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. GAL 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have 
put on Christ. 3:17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred 
and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. </p>
<p>78 </p>
<p>the rest of the world; and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ, 
according to His Word. </p>
<p>Il. There is, in every sacrament, a spiritual relation, or sacramental union, between 
the sign and the thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the names and effects of 
the one are attributed to the other.*" </p>
<p>Il. The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacraments rightly used, is not conferred 
by any power in them; neither does the efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or 
intention of him that does administer it:*» but upon the work of the Spirit,” and the word 
of institution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a 
promise of benefit to worthy receivers.” </p>
<p>IV. There are only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is 
to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord: neither of which may be dispensed by any, 
but by a minister of the Word lawfully ordained.» </p>
<p>513 ROM 15:8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made 
unto the fathers. EXO 12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his males 
be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person 
shall eat thereof. GEN 34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for 
that were a reproach unto us. </p>
<p>514 ROM 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we are 
buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also 
should walk in newness of life. 1CO 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? 
The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of 
devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. </p>
<p>515 GEN 17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among 
you shall be circumcised. MAT 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 28 For 
this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. TIT 3:5 Not by works of righteousness 
which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p>516 ROM 2:28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 29 But he is 
a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, 
but of God. 1PE 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, 
but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>517 MAT 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am 
not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. 1CO 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into 
one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. </p>
<p>518 MAT 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 28 For this is my blood of the 
new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them 
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have 
commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. </p>
<p>519 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. 1CO 11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. 23 For I have received of 
the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. 1CO 4:1 
Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. HEB 5:4 And no man taketh this 
honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. </p>

<p>V. The sacraments of the Old Testament in regard to the spiritual things thereby 
signified and exhibited, were, for substance, the same with those of the new.” </p>
<p>Chapter XXVIII 
Of Baptism </p>
<p>I. Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ,” not only 
for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible Church; but also to be 
unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of his ingrafting into Christ, of 
regeneration,” of remission of sins,™ and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus 
Christ, to walk in the newness of life.” Which sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, 
to be continued in His Church until the end of the world.” </p>
<p>520 1CO 10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all 
passed through the sea; 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 4 
And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. </p>
<p>521 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. </p>
<p>522 1CO 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; 
and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. </p>
<p>523 ROM 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being 
uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be 
imputed unto them also. COL 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the 
body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him 
through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. </p>
<p>524 GAL 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. ROM 6:5 For if we have been planted 
together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. </p>
<p>525 TIT 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of 
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p>526 MAR 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
527 ROM 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we are 
buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also </p>
<p>should walk in newness of life. </p>
<p>528 MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost. </p>
<p>80 </p>
<p>Il. The outward element to be used in this sacrament is water, wherewith the party is 
to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by a 
minister of the Gospel, lawfully called thereunto.” </p>
<p>Ill. Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary; but Baptism is rightly 
administered by pouring, or sprinkling water upon the person.*” </p>
<p>IV. Not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ,*" but 
also the infants of one, or both, believing parents, are to be baptized.” </p>
<p>529 MAT 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am 
not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. JOH 1:33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to 
baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he 
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am 
with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. </p>
<p>530 HEB 9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time 
of reformation. 19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves 
and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, 20 Saying, This is the blood 
of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. 21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of 
the ministry. 22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. ACT 2:41 
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. 
16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. MAR 
7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have 
received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. </p>
<p>531 MAR 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and 
is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. ACT 8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine 
heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 38 And he commanded the chariot to 
stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. </p>
<p>532 GEN 17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting 
covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, 
thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. GAL 3:9 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 14 
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit 
through faith. COL 2:11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the 
sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith 
of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. ACT 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every 
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise 
is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. ROM 4:11 And he 
received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be 
the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 12 And the 
father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father 
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. 1CO 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the 
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. MAT 28:19 Go ye therefore, 
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. MAR 10:13 And they 
brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. 14 But when Jesus 
saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is 
the kingdom of God. 15 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter 
therein. 16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. LUK 18:15 And they brought unto him 
also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. </p>
<p>81 </p>
<p>V. Although it is a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and 
salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated, or 
saved, without it: or, that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.” </p>
<p>VI. The efficacy of Baptism is not tied to that moment of time wherein it is 
administered;*<em> yet, notwithstanding, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace 
promised is not only offered, but really exhibited, and conferred, by the Holy Ghost, to 
such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongs unto, according to the counsel of 
God's own will, in His appointed time.</em>” </p>
<p>VII. The sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administered unto any person.** </p>
<p>Chapter XXIX 
Of the Lord's Supper </p>
<p>I. Our Lord Jesus, in the night wherein He was betrayed, instituted the sacrament of 
His body and blood, called the Lord's Supper, to be observed in His Church, unto the end 
of the world, for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of Himself in His death; the </p>
<p>533 LUK 7:30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. EXO 4:24 
And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him, and sought to kill him. 25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and 
cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. 26 So he let him go: then 
she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. </p>
<p>534 ROM 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being 
uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be 
imputed unto them also. ACT 10:2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, 
and prayed to God alway. 4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy 
prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. 22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that 
feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his 
house, and to hear words of thee. 31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight 
of God. 45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles 
also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have 
received the Holy Ghost as well as we? </p>
<p>535 ACT 8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding 
the miracles and signs which were done. 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. </p>
<p>536 JOH 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God. 8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, 
and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. </p>
<p>537 GAL 3:27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. TIT 3:5 Not by works of righteousness 
which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
EPH 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 26 That he might sanctify and 
cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. ACT 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you 
in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 41 Then they that gladly 
received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. </p>

regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. </p>

<p>sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in 
Him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto Him; and, to be a 
bond and pledge of their communion with Him, and with each other, as members of His 
mystical body. </p>
<p>Il. In this sacrament, Christ is not offered up to His Father; nor any real sacrifice 
made at all, for remission of sins of the quick or dead;<em> but only a commemoration of 
that one offering up of Himself, by Himself, upon the cross, once for all: and a spiritual 
oblation of all possible praise unto God, for the same:</em>' so that the popish sacrifice of the 
mass (as they call it) is most abominably injurious to Christ's one, only sacrifice, the 
alone propitiation for all the sins of His elect.” </p>
<p>Il. The Lord Jesus has, in this ordinance, appointed His ministers to declare His word 
of institution to the people, to pray, and bless the elements of bread and wine, and </p>
<p>539 1CO 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which 
he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken 
for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is 
the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and 
drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. 1CO 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of 
the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 17 For we being many are one 
bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye 
cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 1CO 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, 
whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. </p>
<p>540 HEB 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. 25 Nor yet 
that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; 26 For then must 
he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by 
the sacrifice of himself. 28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the 
second time without sin unto salvation. </p>
<p>541 1CO 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in 
remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in 
my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do 
shew the Lord's death till he come. MAT 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it 
to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink 
ye all of it. </p>
<p>542 HEB 7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 24 But this man, 
because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, 
first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 10:11 And every priest standeth 
daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 12 But this man, after he had offered 
one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God. 14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are 
sanctified. 18 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. </p>
<p>83 </p>
<p>thereby to set them apart from a common to an holy use; and to take and break the bread, 
to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the 
communicants;* but to none who are not then present in the congregation.“ </p>
<p>IV. Private masses, or receiving this sacrament by a priest, or any other alone;** as 
likewise, the denial of the cup to the people,“ worshipping the elements, the lifting them 
up, or carrying them about, for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended 
religious use; are all contrary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of 
Christ.” </p>
<p>V. The outward elements in this sacrament, duly set apart to the uses ordained by 
Christ, have such relation to Him crucified, as that, truly, yet sacramentally only, they are 
sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of 
Christ;** albeit, in substance and nature, they still remain truly and only bread and wine, 
as they were before.” </p>
<p>VI. That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into 
the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by </p>
<p>543 MAT 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, 
eat; this is my body. 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 28 For this is my 
blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. MAR 14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, 
and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. 23 And he took the cup, and when he had given 
thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. 24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed 
for many. LUK 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is 
given for you: this do in remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my 
blood, which is shed for you. 1CO 11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus 
the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my 
body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat 
this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. </p>
<p>544 ACT 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, 
ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. 1CO 11:20 When ye come together therefore into one 
place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. </p>
<p>545 1CO 10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. </p>
<p>546 MAR 14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. 1CO 11:25 After 
the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as 
ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. 
27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of 
the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 29 For he that eateth and 
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. </p>
<p>547 MAT 15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </p>
<p>548 MAT 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, 
eat; this is my body. 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 28 For this is my 
blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. </p>
<p>549 1CO 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. 27 Wherefore 
whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But 
let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. MAT 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink 
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. </p>
<p>84 </p>
<p>consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but 
even to common sense, and reason; overthrows the nature of the sacrament, and has 
been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions; yes, of gross idolatries.*° </p>
<p>VII. Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements, in this sacrament,“ 
do then also, inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally but 
spiritually, receive and feed upon, Christ crucified, and all benefits of His death: the body 
and blood of Christ being then, not corporally or carnally, in, with, or under the bread 
and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, 
as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.*” </p>
<p>VIII. Although ignorant and wicked men receive the outward elements in this 
sacrament; yet, they receive not the thing signified thereby; but, by their unworthy 
coming thereunto, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, to their own damnation. 
Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with 
Him, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table; and cannot, without great sin against 
Christ, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries, or be admitted 
thereunto.” </p>
<p>550 ACT 3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of 
all his holy prophets since the world began. 1CO 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my 
body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat 
this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. LUK 24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he 
spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee. 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit 
hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. </p>
<p>551 1CO 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. </p>
<p>552 1CO 10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is 
it not the communion of the body of Christ? </p>
<p>553 1CO 11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body 
and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 29 For he that 
eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 2CO 6:14 Be ye not 
unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion 
hath light with darkness? 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 16 And 
what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, 
and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. </p>
<p>554 10 5:6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 7 Purge out therefore the old 
leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us. 13 But them that are 
without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. 2TH 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in 
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the 
tradition which he received of us. 14 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with 
him, that he may be ashamed. 15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. MAT 7:6 Give not that which is 
holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. </p>

<p>Chapter XXX </p>
<p>Of Church Censures </p>
<p>L The Lord Jesus, as king and head of His Church, has therein appointed a 
government, in the hand of Church officers, distinct from the civil magistrate. </p>
<p>I. To these officers the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed; by virtue 
whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain, and remit sins; to shut that kingdom 
against the impenitent, both by the Word, and censures; and to open it unto penitent 
sinners, by the ministry of the Gospel; and by absolution from censures, as occasion shall 
require. </p>
<p>IHI. Church censures are necessary, for the reclaiming and gaining of offending 
brethren, for deterring of others from the like offenses, for purging out of that leaven 
which might infect the whole lump, for vindicating the honor of Christ, and the holy 
profession of the Gospel, and for preventing the wrath of God, which might justly fall 
upon the Church, if they should suffer His covenant, and the seals thereof, to be profaned 
by notorious and obstinate offenders.*” </p>
<p>555 ISA 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall 
be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of his 
government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with 
judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. 1TI 5:17 Let the elders 
that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. 1TH 5:12 And we beseech 
you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you. ACT 20:17 And from 
Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, 
from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons. HEB 13:7 Remember them which 
have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. 
17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, 
that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. 24 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and 
all the saints. They of Italy salute you. 1CO 12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly 
teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. MAT 28:18 And Jesus came and 
spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing 
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have 
commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. </p>
<p>556 MAT 16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be 
bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, 
tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. 18 Verily I say 
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in 
heaven. JOH 20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 22 And when 
he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are 
remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. 2CO 2:6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which 
was inflicted of many. 7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be 
swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. </p>
<p>557 (1CO 5 throughout) 1TI 5:20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. MAT 7:6 Give not that which is holy 
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. 1TI 
1:20 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 1CO 11:27 
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the </p>
<p>86 </p>
<p>IV. For the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the Church are to proceed by 
admonition; suspension from the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for a season; and by 
excommunication from the Church; according to the nature of the crime, and demerit of 
the person.** </p>
<p>Chapter XXXI 
Of Synods and Councils </p>
<p>I. For the better government, and further edification of the Church, there ought to be 
such assemblies as are commonly called synods or councils.: </p>
<p>Il. As magistrates may lawfully call a synod of ministers, and other fit persons, to 
consult and advise with, about matters of religion; so, if magistrates be open enemies to 
the Church, the ministers of Christ, of themselves, by virtue of their office, or they, with </p>
<p>Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh 
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 30 For this cause many are weak and sickly 
among you, and many sleep. 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are 
chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, 
tarry one for another. 34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest 
will I set in order when I come. JUD 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by 
the flesh. </p>
<p>558 1TH 5:12 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish 
you. 2TH 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every 
brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 14 And if any man obey not our word by this 
epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. 15 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish 
him as a brother. 1CO 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, 5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of 
the Lord Jesus. 13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. MAT 
18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an 
heathen man and a publican. TIT 3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject. </p>
<p>559 ACT 15:2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul 
and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 4 And when 
they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that 
God had done with them. 6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. </p>
<p>560 ISA 49:23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their 
face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that 
wait for me. 1TI 2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all 
men; 2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 2CH 
19:8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the 
judgment of the Lord, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. 9 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in 
the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 10 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in 
their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they 
trespass not against the Lord, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. 11 And, 
behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of 
Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the 
good. (2CH 29-30 throughout) MAT 2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he 
demanded of them where Christ should be born. 5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the 
prophet. PRO 11:14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellers there is safety. </p>
<p>87 </p>
<p>other fit persons upon delegation from their Churches, may meet together in such 
assemblies." </p>
<p>Ill. It belongs to synods and councils, ministerially to determine controversies of faith, 
and cases of conscience; to set down rules and directions for the better ordering of the 
public worship of God, and government of his Church; to receive complaints in cases of 
maladministration, and authoritatively to determine the same; which decrees and 
determinations, if consonant to the Word of God, are to be received with reverence and 
submission; not only for their agreement with the Word, but also for the power whereby 
they are made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in His Word.‘ </p>
<p>IV. All synods or councils, since the apostles' times, whether general or particular, 
may err; and many have erred. Therefore they are not to be made the rule of faith, or 
practice; but to be used as a help in both. </p>
<p>V.  Synods and councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that which is 
ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs which concern the </p>
<p>561 ACT 15:2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul 
and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 4 And when 
they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that 
God had done with them. 22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own 
company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 23 And 
they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the 
Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto 
you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul. </p>
<p>562 ACT 15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written. 19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not 
them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God. 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have 
troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such 
commandment. 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. 28 For it seemed 
good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 29 That ye abstain from meats 
offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do 
well. Fare ye well. 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, 
they delivered the epistle: 31 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 16:4 And as they went through the 
cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. MAT 
18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an 
heathen man and a publican. 18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever 
ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. 19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any 
thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered together 
in my name, there am I in the midst of them. </p>
<p>563 EPH 2:20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone. 
ACT 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and 
searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 1CO 2:5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in 
the power of God. 2CO 1:24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. </p>

<p>commonwealth, unless by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary; or, by way of 
advice, for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto required by the civil 
magistrate. </p>
<p>Chapter XXXII 
Of the State of Men after Death, and of the </p>
<p>Resurrection of the Dead </p>
<p>IL The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption: but their souls, 
which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God 
who gave them: the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are 
received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, 
waiting for the full redemption of their bodies.<em>” And the souls of the wicked are cast into 
hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the 
great day.</em>* Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture 
acknowledges none. </p>
<p>564 LUK 12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 14 
And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? JOH 18:36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this 
world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my 
kingdom not from hence. </p>
<p>565 GEN 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust 
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. ACT 13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on 
sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption. </p>
<p>566 LUK 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. ECC 12:7 Then shall 
the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. </p>
<p>567 HEB 12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and 
to the spirits of just men made perfect. 2CO 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a 
building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst 
we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, 
and to be present with the Lord. PHI 1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is 
far better. ACT 3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the 
mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. EPH 4:10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all 
heavens, that he might fill all things. </p>
<p>568 LUK 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 And 
he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my 
tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. ACT 1:25 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by 
transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. JUD 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own 
habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 7 Even as Sodom and 
Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set 
forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. 1PE 3:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in 
prison. </p>
<p>89 </p>
<p>Il. At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed: and all the 
dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other (although with different 
qualities), which shall be united again to their souls forever.” </p>
<p>Il. The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonor: the 
bodies of the just, by His Spirit, unto honor; and be made conformable to His own 
glorious body. </p>
<p>Chapter XXXIII 
Of the Last Judgment </p>
<p>I. God has appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world, in righteousness, by 
Jesus Christ, to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father. In which day, 
not only the apostate angels shall be judged,” but likewise all persons that have lived 
upon earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, 
words, and deeds; and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether 
good or evil.” </p>
<p>569 1TH 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: 
and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 1CO 15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be 
changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised 
incorruptible, and we shall be changed. </p>
<p>570 JOB 19:26 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 27 Whom I shall see for 
myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. 1CO 15:42 So also is the 
resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is 
sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there 
is a spiritual body. </p>
<p>571 ACT 24:15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both 
of the just and unjust. JOH 5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his 
voice, 29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the 
resurrection of damnation. 1CO 15:43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. 
PHI 3:21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby 
he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. </p>
<p>572 ACT 17:31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath 
ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. </p>
<p>573 JOH 5:27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </p>
<p>574 1CO 6:3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? JUD 6 And the angels which 
kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of 
the great day. 2PE 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of 
darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. </p>
<p>575 2C0 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, 
according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. ECC 12:14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every 
secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. ROM 2:16 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus 
Christ according to my gospel. 14:10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall 
all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. MAT 12:36 But I say </p>
<p>90 </p>
<p>Il. The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of His 
mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of His justice, in the damnation of the 
reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into 
everlasting life, and receive that fullness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from 
the presence of the Lord; but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting 
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.” </p>
<p>Ill. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a day of 
judgment, both to deter all men from sin; and for the greater consolation of the godly in 
their adversity: so will He have that day unknown to men, that they may shake off all </p>
<p>unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 37 For by thy words 
thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. </p>
<p>576 MAT 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of 
his glory: 32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his 
sheep from the goats: 33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then shall the King say unto 
them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 36 Naked, 
and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 37 Then shall the righteous answer him, 
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? 38 When saw we thee a stranger, and 
took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 40 And the King shall 
answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have 
done it unto me. 41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for 
the devil and his angels: 42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 43 I was a 
stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 44 Then shall they also 
answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not 
minister unto thee? 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of 
these, ye did it not to me. 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. ROM 2:5 But 
after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous 
judgment of God; 6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds: ROM 9:22 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and 
to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 23 And that he might make 
known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory. MAT 5:21 His lord said unto him, 
Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter 
thou into the joy of thy lord. ACT 3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of 
refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; 2TH 1:7 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall 
be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not 
the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from 
the glory of his power; 10 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe(because our 
testimony among you was believed) in that day. </p>
<p>577 2PE 3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation 
and godliness. 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, 
without spot, and blameless. 2CO 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the 
things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we 
persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 2TH 1:5 Which is a 
manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 
6 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; 7 And to you who are troubled rest 
with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, LUK 21:7 And they asked him, saying, 
Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass? 28 And when these 
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. ROM 8:23 And not only 
they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, 
to wit, the redemption of our body. 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth 
he yet hope for? 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. </p>

<p>carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord 
will come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen. </p>
<p>578 MAT 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 42 Watch therefore: 
for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the 
thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. 44 Therefore be ye also ready: 
for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. MAR 13:35 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of 
the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 36 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. 
37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. LUK 12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 36 And ye 
yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they 
may open unto him immediately. REV 22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, 
Lord Jesus </p>
