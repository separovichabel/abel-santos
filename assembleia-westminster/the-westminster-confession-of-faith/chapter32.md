# Chapter 32: Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead

## **I.**
The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption **(a)**: but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them **(b)**: the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies **(c)**. And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day **(d)**. Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledges none.

**(a)** Genesis 3:19; Acts 13:36.

**(b)** Luke 23:43; Ecclesiastes 12:7.

**(c)** Hebrews 12:23; 2 Corinthians 5:1,6-8; Philippians 1:23; Acts 3:21; Ephesians 4:10.

**(d)** Luke 16:23-24; Acts 1:25; Jude 6-7; 1 Peter 3:19.

## **II.**
At the last day, such as are found alive shall not die, but be changed **(a)**: and all the dead shall be raised up, with the selfsame bodies, and none other (although with different qualities), which shall be united again to their souls forever **(b)**.

**(a)** 1 Thessalonians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.

**(b)** Job 19:26-27; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44.

## **III.**
The bodies of the unjust shall, by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonor: the bodies of the just, by His Spirit, unto honor; and be made conformable to His own glorious body **(a)**.

**(a)** Acts 24:15; John 5:28-29; 1 Corinthians 15:43; Philippians 3:21.
